1
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:37,216
<i>The forests of Pandora have many dangers.</i>

2
00:01:43,989 --> 00:01:46,955
<i>But the most dangerous
thing about Pandora is…</i>

3
00:01:50,758 --> 00:01:53,736
<i>...that you may end
up loving him too much.</i>

4
00:02:05,802 --> 00:02:11,729
<i>We sing the chords to remember.
Each pearl is a story of our life.</i>

5
00:02:13,937 --> 00:02:16,891
<i>A jewel for the birth of our son.</i>

6
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:22,288
Netay!

7
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:24,284
Netay!

8
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,772
<i>A jewel for our adopted daughter, Kiri, -</i>

9
00:02:34,702 --> 00:02:37,836
<i>born from the avatar of Grace, -</i>

10
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:40,827
<i>and whose design
was a complete mystery.</i>

11
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,556
<i>A jewel for the first meeting with Eywa.</i>

12
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:05,935
<i>People say we live in Eywa, -</i>

13
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,318
<i>and Eywa lives in us.</i>

14
00:03:10,986 --> 00:03:15,911
The great mother takes
care of all her children.

15
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,809
Happiness is simple.

16
00:03:27,103 --> 00:03:30,083
I think a toad like
me would find it.

17
00:03:33,052 --> 00:03:37,636
The first time I met your
father, I tried to kill him.

18
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,618
Love at first sight.

19
00:03:39,981 --> 00:03:42,936
Before I knew it, we had four.

20
00:03:45,565 --> 00:03:49,496
We sent people from heaven
back to Earth, but some stayed here.

21
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,475
Scientists loyal to the Na'vi.

22
00:03:53,485 --> 00:03:57,066
And then there was
Spider. He was trapped here.

23
00:03:57,185 --> 00:04:00,135
Too young for a cryocapsule.

24
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:06,142
The war had taken his parents, so
he was brought up by the scientists.

25
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:12,232
He was like a stray
cat that kept running.

26
00:04:13,224 --> 00:04:16,178
He and our children were inseparable.

27
00:04:18,831 --> 00:04:23,971
For Neytiri, he would always
be a stranger. One of them.

28
00:04:23,995 --> 00:04:26,969
He belongs among his own.

29
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:34,560
- I got it first!
- Why do you have to have?

30
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:37,536
I was a few years away from having
my tongue hammered into the tuber.

31
00:04:37,723 --> 00:04:40,664
But now it comes naturally to me.

32
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,832
I hate you!

33
00:04:42,856 --> 00:04:46,785
I hate you to no end, Lo'ak! Crazy face!

34
00:04:46,809 --> 00:04:50,743
Wow, that's good.
Soon the firewood falls.

35
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:55,693
He immediately emerges
from the rocks. Here it is.

36
00:04:57,495 --> 00:04:59,477
Like, take it.

37
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:07,254
Neteyam, the great fisherman. Good boy.

38
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:15,363
- It's a big crab.
- By the stones, as you said.

39
00:05:15,736 --> 00:05:18,809
- What is his size?
- So big.

40
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:21,814
Time passes. Like a dream.

41
00:05:23,118 --> 00:05:26,072
- Kiri.
- Come here, brother.

42
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:28,071
Smile, skxawng.

43
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:30,773
Happiness is simple.

44
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,751
It can be a date night without children.

45
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,498
It's just luck...

46
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,462
...that it can end abruptly.

47
00:06:20,377 --> 00:06:22,371
A new star in the night sky.

48
00:06:24,054 --> 00:06:27,013
It could only mean one thing.

49
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:35,895
Ships slow down.

50
00:06:43,814 --> 00:06:45,795
The People of Heaven were back.

51
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:08,752
<i><b>ONE YEAR LATER</b></i>

52
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:18,611
Heart rate increases.

53
00:09:18,635 --> 00:09:22,593
They will probably get there. Take it easy.

54
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,546
Good pupillary reaction.

55
00:09:27,514 --> 00:09:28,497
Take it out there.

56
00:09:28,521 --> 00:09:31,488
Colonel, can you hear me?

57
00:09:35,422 --> 00:09:37,171
Please lie down.

58
00:09:37,798 --> 00:10:33,621

59
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:41,725
- Stun him!
- Hurry up!

60
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:45,658
- Call the guards!
- Grab it!

61
00:10:45,682 --> 00:10:49,606
Hold it! Calm down, Colonel!

62
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,573
It's me, Corporal Wainfleet!

63
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:59,489
Lyle? Is it you?

64
00:10:59,513 --> 00:11:02,461
Yes, and Z Dog.

65
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:05,435
And Fike.

66
00:11:08,385 --> 00:11:11,357
Let me go. I am completely calm.

67
00:11:32,104 --> 00:11:36,059
It didn't matter.

68
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:50,870
Attention. Two minutes
to land on Pandora.

69
00:11:52,854 --> 00:11:54,816
The umbilical cord is missing.

70
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,813
Oxygen absorption: 89.

71
00:11:57,802 --> 00:12:01,725
In case you're in any doubt,
you're Colonel Miles Quaritch, -

72
00:12:01,749 --> 00:12:06,674
just younger, taller,
bluer and less pretty.

73
00:12:06,698 --> 00:12:10,619
In two hours, I will
attack the Na'vi fortress.

74
00:12:10,643 --> 00:12:15,556
It was deemed desirable
that I make this backup.

75
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,520
And if you see it, that
means I put the hooves away.

76
00:12:21,522 --> 00:12:25,442
Parker, what else can I say?

77
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:29,392
Just remind him how it works.

78
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:33,350
Your memories and personality
are sent back to Earth, -

79
00:12:33,374 --> 00:12:37,328
where you are grown.
You will make them inculcate...

80
00:12:38,297 --> 00:12:41,279
Is it me or is it you doing this?

81
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:47,175
The idea is to transfer the psyche of
the toughest extraterrestrial actors -

82
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:53,107
as Corporal
Wainfleet and signed -

83
00:12:53,131 --> 00:12:55,110
for recombinant bodies.

84
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:00,026
You are a recombined soul
with my memories and my charm.

85
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:04,001
You won't be able to remember my
death because it hasn't happened yet.

86
00:13:04,969 --> 00:13:07,915
And it won't either.

87
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:12,869
No matter what, you, as a clone
of me, will thirst for revenge, -

88
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:16,837
mostly about Jake Sully.

89
00:13:19,394 --> 00:13:22,353
Remember that a Marine
can never be defeated.

90
00:13:22,377 --> 00:13:27,317
You can kill us, but
we'll regroup in hell.

91
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:30,261
Semper fi.

92
00:13:59,945 --> 00:14:01,912
Ground Force Now!

93
00:14:55,257 --> 00:14:57,241
Take them here!

94
00:15:01,187 --> 00:15:03,165
Two minutes, guys.

95
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:11,045
- We have to go, bro.
- Father is going to kill us.

96
00:15:11,365 --> 00:15:13,327
Now don't be an asshole.

97
00:15:13,351 --> 00:15:16,306
Lo'ak, come back!

98
00:15:19,271 --> 00:15:22,240
The whole box should be included,
both magazines and fuze guides.

99
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,147
- Go brother!
- Lo'ak!

100
00:15:31,117 --> 00:15:34,077
Take it. Take a gun, kid.

101
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:38,045
Lo'ak, you don't even
know how to use it.

102
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:40,029
Dad showed me this.

103
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:49,904
A combat helicopter!

104
00:15:56,818 --> 00:15:58,779
Go brother!

105
00:16:08,657 --> 00:16:11,605
Lo'ak, where are you? Netay!

106
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:15,554
Are you unharmed? Where is your brother

107
00:16:15,578 --> 00:16:17,570
- The low.
- Hurry up!

108
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,526
Netay!

109
00:16:22,507 --> 00:16:24,479
Oh no.

110
00:16:34,353 --> 00:16:35,341
Sheep?

111
00:16:38,304 --> 00:16:40,280
What the hell are you doing here?

112
00:16:41,272 --> 00:16:43,240
Sorry.

113
00:16:44,232 --> 00:16:45,228
Sorry dad.

114
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:52,065
We are no longer in Kansas.

115
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:55,029
We are on our way to Pandora.

116
00:16:55,998 --> 00:17:00,939
I know you are all
asking the same question:

117
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,880
Is it Blue Monday?

118
00:17:08,854 --> 00:17:13,770
The sins of the past have
made us reborn as our enemies.

119
00:17:13,794 --> 00:17:17,750
We have their size,
their strength, their speed.

120
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:22,682
Added to our training,
it is a powerful cocktail.

121
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:27,592
- Do we have a mission?
- We have this.

122
00:17:27,616 --> 00:17:31,579
Our mission is to find and kill
the leader of the Na'vi rebel army.

123
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:35,532
It is called "toruk makto".

124
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,509
Jake Sulley.

125
00:17:46,394 --> 00:17:50,320
Attack attack! I got you!

126
00:17:50,344 --> 00:17:51,340
Come on, Tuk.

127
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:57,238
I'm definitely faster when I'm blue.
And animals show me more respect.

128
00:17:57,262 --> 00:18:02,191
- They don't see me as a person.
- Wait, are you human?

129
00:18:13,881 --> 00:18:14,861
They arrive!

130
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:18,823
<i><b>THE FORTRESS OF THE OMATIKAYAS</b></i>

131
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,774
They arrive! Kiri! Spider!

132
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:25,715
The warriors are back! Has come!

133
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:26,734
Come with me.

134
00:18:41,545 --> 00:18:44,501
- Mother!
- Boom, boom, boom.

135
00:18:46,487 --> 00:18:48,460
Intensify.

136
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:54,401
You are scouts. You have to keep
an eye out for enemies. At a distance!

137
00:18:55,369 --> 00:19:01,278
Sound familiar? Here I let you steal
a mission and then you disobeyed.

138
00:19:02,202 --> 00:19:06,169
- Kiri, help the injured.
- My brother is also injured.

139
00:19:07,138 --> 00:19:11,085
- Tuk, go with her.
- Father, I take full responsibility.

140
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:16,031
Yes, because you are the oldest
and you must behave accordingly.

141
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:21,961
- MaJake, your son is bleeding.
- It's okay, mother.

142
00:19:23,939 --> 00:19:25,915
Come in and get patched up.

143
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,807
You must be aware that you
almost had your brother killed.

144
00:19:37,782 --> 00:19:40,711
You are banned from flying for a month.

145
00:19:40,735 --> 00:19:45,666
Look at the Ukrainians. All. And
wipe the wickedness from your face.

146
00:19:53,578 --> 00:19:56,553
- Should I breathe on it?
- Give him this.

147
00:19:57,521 --> 00:20:02,439
- I would use yalnabark.
- Oh. Who is tsahik here?

148
00:20:02,463 --> 00:20:06,432
You are, grandma,
but yalnabark is better.

149
00:20:09,381 --> 00:20:12,338
- It hurts less.
- Powerful warriors.

150
00:20:19,274 --> 00:20:21,229
What is that?

151
00:20:23,216 --> 00:20:27,145
Neteyam and Lo'ak are
trying to live up to you.

152
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:30,108
It's hard for them.

153
00:20:30,132 --> 00:20:32,108
I know.

154
00:20:33,105 --> 00:20:35,081
You are tough on them.

155
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:41,964
I am their father. It's my job.

156
00:20:41,988 --> 00:20:44,958
We are not a platoon. We are a family.

157
00:20:56,793 --> 00:20:58,791
I thought we lost him.

158
00:21:06,685 --> 00:21:09,616
- Hi there.
- Hey, Spider.

159
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,587
- I'll knock you out.
- Just come.

160
00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:15,584
Only avatars are allowed
here. To go for a walk.

161
00:21:16,552 --> 00:21:20,524
- Blue stripes do not grow.
- I can still dismiss you.

162
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:27,425
- What a day.
- It was long.

163
00:21:28,426 --> 00:21:33,338
Very funny. It's so clean there that you
can breathe the air of the earth for hours.

164
00:21:33,362 --> 00:21:36,308
I can only inhale yours for ten seconds.

165
00:21:36,332 --> 00:21:41,254
Yes, it's downright, monkey cat. For you.

166
00:21:48,781 --> 00:21:50,771
- Hi Max.
- Hey, kids.

167
00:21:58,663 --> 00:22:00,647
Hi Mom.

168
00:22:09,545 --> 00:22:14,449
Maybe I'm getting cocky,
but I see real evidence -

169
00:22:14,473 --> 00:22:18,434
on a systemic response
at the global level.

170
00:22:19,402 --> 00:22:21,363
I can't...

171
00:22:21,387 --> 00:22:25,315
I will not use the word "intelligence".

172
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:28,277
“Awareness” is probably a better word.

173
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:32,230
It's as if the whole biosphere of Pandora -

174
00:22:32,254 --> 00:22:37,191
is conscious and able
to respond cognitively.

175
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:43,107
I can't say that.
Then they crucify me.

176
00:22:43,131 --> 00:22:47,058
Who do you think made her eggs?

177
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:51,001
- It was guaranteed Norm.
- Absolutely.

178
00:22:51,025 --> 00:22:53,975
- You don't deserve to live.
- Think about it.

179
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:56,941
He is constantly with her.

180
00:22:56,965 --> 00:23:00,882
I wanted to kill myself.
I wanted to drink acid.

181
00:23:00,906 --> 00:23:05,834
He's in all the recordings.
Look at the look he gives her.

182
00:23:06,841 --> 00:23:11,744
I imagine their avatars
together in the woods…

183
00:23:11,768 --> 00:23:12,745
All alone!

184
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:16,717
It's not always cool to
know who your father was.

185
00:23:21,644 --> 00:23:24,592
Hole in it. I don't even remember him.

186
00:23:25,715 --> 00:23:27,670
No, Spider...

187
00:23:27,694 --> 00:23:30,640
Spider...

188
00:23:30,664 --> 00:23:33,616
You are not him.

189
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:44,481
<i><b>BRIDGE CITY</b></i>

190
00:24:12,157 --> 00:24:15,093
Inside the airport!

191
00:24:15,117 --> 00:24:18,072
No stay! Go!

192
00:24:21,033 --> 00:24:23,015
Masks removed.

193
00:24:26,957 --> 00:24:29,928
Colonel, it's the general.

194
00:24:38,816 --> 00:24:39,815
General Armore.

195
00:24:40,807 --> 00:24:44,720
Nice to meet you, colonel.
I hear good things.

196
00:24:44,744 --> 00:24:48,703
But a lot has changed since
your last visit here. Has come.

197
00:24:51,653 --> 00:24:55,588
The new command center
has just been commissioned.

198
00:24:55,612 --> 00:24:59,543
Installers can erect
a building in six days.

199
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:04,490
We have done more here in one
year than in the previous 30 years.

200
00:25:04,514 --> 00:25:11,421
We are not here to operate a mine.
I have a much more important mission.

201
00:25:16,872 --> 00:25:18,826
The earth is dying.

202
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:23,577
Our task is to tame the desert -

203
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:28,550
with the aim of making Pandora
the new home of humanity.

204
00:25:29,518 --> 00:25:34,469
But before we can do that,
we must appease the savages.

205
00:25:36,437 --> 00:25:40,372
Sully's quirks grew
bolder and more frequent.

206
00:25:40,396 --> 00:25:45,322
His attacks are well executed. There
is good coordination between the troops.

207
00:25:45,346 --> 00:25:51,244
They attack mines and pipelines
and sabotage our supply chain.

208
00:25:51,268 --> 00:25:55,213
They attacked a magnetic
train two days ago.

209
00:25:59,163 --> 00:26:04,116
- Do we know anything about Sully's base?
- Yes. Show me the mountains.

210
00:26:05,084 --> 00:26:08,056
It is a cave system in
the Hallelujah Mountains.

211
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:13,995
But every time we send
troops there, we suffer losses.

212
00:26:14,964 --> 00:26:17,945
It's like stinging a wasp's nest.

213
00:26:18,913 --> 00:26:22,883
After ten minutes in their
airspace, they swarm around us.

214
00:26:24,852 --> 00:26:28,785
Colonel, we believe your blue
team will be mistaken for natives -

215
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:31,745
and not trigger an immune reaction.

216
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:34,726
How to test this hypothesis?

217
00:26:35,717 --> 00:26:37,686
Hard.

218
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,656
Tremendous.

219
00:26:53,496 --> 00:26:57,444
- We are approaching enemy airspace.
- Received.

220
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:10,306
- Come on, monkey!
- Wait for me!

221
00:27:48,153 --> 00:27:52,077
- Tuk, come on.
- Okay okay.

222
00:27:52,101 --> 00:27:54,054
Why did you bring her?

223
00:27:54,078 --> 00:27:58,987
The princess who honks. "I'm chatting.
You mustn't go to the battlefield.

224
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,990
I'll tell mom if you
don't take me."

225
00:28:03,427 --> 00:28:04,423
Come on.

226
00:28:05,941 --> 00:28:09,886
- How crazy!
- Is there a body?

227
00:28:56,303 --> 00:28:57,302
Oh man.

228
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:10,141
Kiri? Kiri.

229
00:29:13,104 --> 00:29:15,095
Kiri. Kir...

230
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:25,927
- Are you OK?
- I did it again, didn't I?

231
00:29:25,951 --> 00:29:27,928
Yes you can.

232
00:29:28,914 --> 00:29:30,865
Kiri!

233
00:29:30,889 --> 00:29:32,872
- You have to see to come back.
- Has come.

234
00:29:38,665 --> 00:29:40,616
What is that?

235
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,612
We have to be home before dark.

236
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,526
- Too big to be human.
- Avatars?

237
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,513
Maybe, but none of us.

238
00:29:53,481 --> 00:29:55,466
- What are you doing?
- Follow leads.

239
00:30:14,244 --> 00:30:16,220
Keep your back covered.

240
00:30:19,176 --> 00:30:21,140
Secured.

241
00:30:23,132 --> 00:30:25,091
Make a phone call.

242
00:30:37,943 --> 00:30:39,915
Holy shit.

243
00:31:03,077 --> 00:31:06,012
We shouldn't be here at all.

244
00:31:06,036 --> 00:31:10,956
Dad gives you a no-fly
zone for the rest of your life.

245
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,913
We have to look into the matter.

246
00:31:30,734 --> 00:31:36,628
Brother, that's where your
dad and my dad fought.

247
00:31:36,652 --> 00:31:40,601
- It's your father's suit.
- Holy shit...

248
00:31:41,592 --> 00:31:44,569
Lyle, check the data on the camera.

249
00:31:46,524 --> 00:31:49,501
- It's dead, Colonel.
- U.S. too.

250
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:54,444
- I have to report it.
- We have so many problems.

251
00:31:59,368 --> 00:32:03,317
- They're going Dog, it's Eagle Eye.
- Eagle Eye, step forward.

252
00:32:03,341 --> 00:32:09,227
I spotted someone.
They look like avatars, -

253
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:14,177
but they carry camouflage
and assault rifles. There are six.

254
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:17,133
What is your position?

255
00:32:17,157 --> 00:32:20,116
We are at the old cabin.

256
00:32:22,092 --> 00:32:24,054
Who are we"?

257
00:32:24,078 --> 00:32:27,034
Me, Spider, Kiri...

258
00:32:28,028 --> 00:32:30,010
...and Tuk.

259
00:32:33,966 --> 00:32:37,917
Now you listen very
well. Step back in silence.

260
00:32:38,885 --> 00:32:43,825
- Hurry away. Understood?
- Yes. We are on the way.

261
00:32:44,821 --> 00:32:46,799
Dad, I know a loophole.

262
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,657
- You're in so much trouble.
- Now stop it, Kiri.

263
00:32:57,681 --> 00:33:00,631
It is immediately the eclipse.

264
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:05,565
- Put it down or I'll shoot!
- Come with me.

265
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:07,549
- Let it go!
- Right now!

266
00:33:09,532 --> 00:33:10,531
Put it on, put it on.

267
00:33:14,475 --> 00:33:19,398
Come here! On your knees!
Stop bragging.

268
00:33:19,422 --> 00:33:23,347
- Visit them for weapons.
- Kiri!

269
00:33:23,371 --> 00:33:26,312
Take it easy.

270
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:28,311
Shut up!

271
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,269
What do we have here?

272
00:33:40,154 --> 00:33:45,091
Listen, colonel. Four fingers.
He's a half-breed.

273
00:33:52,023 --> 00:33:55,955
Show me your fingers.

274
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:01,892
You are his, aren't you?

275
00:34:04,867 --> 00:34:07,827
Yes, you are his.

276
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,819
Where is he?

277
00:34:15,843 --> 00:34:18,772
Unfortunately I don't speak English -

278
00:34:18,796 --> 00:34:20,752
with assholes.

279
00:34:20,776 --> 00:34:23,748
Where is your father?

280
00:34:28,673 --> 00:34:30,662
Should he be with?

281
00:34:32,627 --> 00:34:33,622
Shut up!

282
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:41,515
- Kiri! No, don't do that!
- You don't touch her!

283
00:34:42,516 --> 00:34:44,491
You must not hurt her.

284
00:34:46,453 --> 00:34:49,433
- Stay still.
- What's your name, kid?

285
00:34:51,401 --> 00:34:55,342
Socorro spider.

286
00:35:03,251 --> 00:35:05,224
Miles?

287
00:35:08,183 --> 00:35:10,163
Nobody calls me that.

288
00:35:12,141 --> 00:35:17,091
It was hell. I assumed
you were sent back to Earth.

289
00:35:19,052 --> 00:35:22,031
Children cannot tolerate cryo, clap hat.

290
00:35:27,954 --> 00:35:29,918
What are we doing, boss?

291
00:35:31,907 --> 00:35:34,859
Iron Sky, Blue 1 here.

292
00:35:38,813 --> 00:35:42,762
- Blue 1, move forward.
- We are ready for collection.

293
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:48,667
- Get us here.
- Dragonfly starts collecting.

294
00:35:48,691 --> 00:35:51,639
We are bringing in very valuable prisoners.

295
00:35:51,663 --> 00:35:55,599
- Blue 1, we're on our way.
- Arrival in ten.

296
00:35:55,623 --> 00:35:57,599
We count.

297
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:07,090
Lyle, pass me the sound on this one.

298
00:36:10,057 --> 00:36:13,995
- She's Sully's wife.
- It's a wild animal.

299
00:36:15,628 --> 00:37:03,677
<font color="#ff99ec">Translated, edited & synced by</font>
<font color="#80d9ff">--- MARIB ---</font>

300
00:37:04,318 --> 00:37:06,500
Give it up, Quaritch.

301
00:37:07,271 --> 00:37:10,232
- Sully.
- Stupid pig.

302
00:37:10,873 --> 00:37:13,139
It's not over as
long as I breathe.

303
00:37:13,676 --> 00:37:15,659
I was hoping you would say that.

304
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:36,966
- You stay with the Iranians.
- But I'm a warrior like you.

305
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,995
I will say no more.

306
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,904
Yes.

307
00:38:04,872 --> 00:38:07,831
There is nothing after.

308
00:38:19,694 --> 00:38:22,648
Should we save the remains?

309
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:50,324
Blue 1, we'll be there in three minutes.

310
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:53,272
Three minutes.

311
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,095
Cover our backs.

312
00:39:57,491 --> 00:39:58,479
Shut up!

313
00:40:13,293 --> 00:40:14,281
So clap!

314
00:40:17,143 --> 00:40:19,128
Skirmish in the back!

315
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,070
Lo'ak!

316
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,986
Little shit!

317
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,975
- Tuk, come on!
- Race!

318
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:42,829
Come with me!

319
00:40:42,853 --> 00:40:44,821
Covered!

320
00:40:48,309 --> 00:40:49,300
Go on!

321
00:41:05,036 --> 00:41:10,958
Is that you, Mrs. Sully?
I recognize your business card.

322
00:41:20,223 --> 00:41:27,129
Walk freely, Mrs. Sully.
We two have unfinished business.

323
00:41:32,661 --> 00:41:36,612
Demon! I will kill you
as many times as it takes.

324
00:41:37,606 --> 00:41:41,546
You and the corporal have
been really diligent, haven't you?

325
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:46,507
You raised a litter of half-breeds.

326
00:41:54,409 --> 00:41:56,378
Na'vier!

327
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,307
Run Run run!

328
00:42:02,299 --> 00:42:06,259
How are you, kid? Follow me. Clear?

329
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,304
Now!

330
00:42:13,258 --> 00:42:14,250
Go on!

331
00:42:23,134 --> 00:42:26,100
- Run Run run!
- After them!

332
00:42:33,013 --> 00:42:34,010
Spider?

333
00:42:37,948 --> 00:42:40,895
- Spider!
- Kiri!

334
00:42:40,919 --> 00:42:42,868
Come here!

335
00:42:42,892 --> 00:42:44,884
The spider is over there!

336
00:42:50,796 --> 00:42:55,743
- So we're ahead. We have ten minutes.
- Blue 1, return to collection point.

337
00:43:03,641 --> 00:43:05,630
- Blue 1, step back.
- Return!

338
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:08,594
Back back! To take off!

339
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:15,468
Kiri, come on! Has come!

340
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:17,472
Run Run run!

341
00:43:20,643 --> 00:43:22,611
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine.

342
00:43:22,635 --> 00:43:24,609
Tuk, are you hurt?

343
00:43:44,577 --> 00:43:47,517
So the danger has passed.
Is everyone unharmed?

344
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,512
Tuk!

345
00:43:52,468 --> 00:43:54,428
We did it.

346
00:43:54,452 --> 00:43:58,414
Thank you, All courage is, thank you.

347
00:43:58,483 --> 00:44:00,443
Where is the spider?

348
00:44:00,467 --> 00:44:04,402
They took him away.
They took him away.

349
00:44:04,426 --> 00:44:09,354
Calm down, honey. He's a cool boy.

350
00:44:11,328 --> 00:44:13,319
It probably will.

351
00:44:14,287 --> 00:44:17,250
We'll probably all get
through this together.

352
00:44:25,482 --> 00:44:26,488
Before hell!

353
00:44:31,417 --> 00:44:32,414
Let me out!

354
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:45,251
He has become like a savage.
He thinks he is one of them.

355
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:53,166
The Quaritch creature can wade
here without Eywa spotting it.

356
00:44:54,135 --> 00:44:58,072
- Our house is here.
- This applies to our children.

357
00:44:58,096 --> 00:45:01,055
You can't ask me that.

358
00:45:03,029 --> 00:45:06,962
I cannot leave my
people. I'm not going to.

359
00:45:06,986 --> 00:45:10,916
He is chasing us. He's after our family.

360
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:16,874
You can't ask me that. Children
only know the forest. Our home is here!

361
00:45:17,842 --> 00:45:21,805
He had our children. He
had them under his knife.

362
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:32,566
My father gave me the
bow here when he was dying.

363
00:45:32,759 --> 00:45:37,588
He told me to protect
people. You are Toruk Makto!

364
00:45:37,612 --> 00:45:42,528
It will protect people. Quaritch
has Spider and he knows everything.

365
00:45:42,552 --> 00:45:45,497
He can lead them right here.

366
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:50,045
If people hide us,
they will be killed.

367
00:45:51,269 --> 00:45:53,252
Do you understand?

368
00:45:57,191 --> 00:46:01,151
I have nothing. I have no plan.

369
00:46:03,118 --> 00:46:06,092
But I can protect our family.

370
00:46:19,906 --> 00:46:20,910
One thing I know.

371
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:28,800
Wherever we are, the
family is our fortress.

372
00:46:40,669 --> 00:46:44,610
- Where's Jake Sully?
- I do not know!

373
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,546
- We know, you know.
- I do not know!

374
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:52,513
Form an image in your mind.
Does it represent the floating mountains?

375
00:46:53,802 --> 00:46:56,779
- Release me!
- He bristles against.

376
00:46:57,747 --> 00:47:00,700
Dan a thought and we'll see.

377
00:47:00,724 --> 00:47:05,635
- I do not know!
- I don't like it either.

378
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:10,591
- Which clans protect him?
- I have no idea!

379
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:13,573
The front patch is going absolutely crazy.

380
00:47:14,542 --> 00:47:18,478
It won't stop until
you tell us where he is.

381
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,473
I don't know, assholes!

382
00:47:35,288 --> 00:47:38,264
Let me try the personal angle.

383
00:47:42,204 --> 00:47:44,192
He's not your son.

384
00:48:14,802 --> 00:48:16,779
Calm, Tarzan, calm.

385
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:27,647
Are you calm?

386
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:38,496
You are cool, kid. The researchers
gave you the approximate file, -

387
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,697
but you didn't reveal anything.

388
00:48:43,665 --> 00:48:46,636
I respect that.

389
00:48:50,582 --> 00:48:52,570
Maybe you want that.

390
00:49:00,461 --> 00:49:03,411
This is Colonel Miles Quaritch. Deceased.

391
00:49:03,435 --> 00:49:06,389
The drop in service.

392
00:49:11,325 --> 00:49:13,296
I am not him.

393
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:18,471
But I have his memories.

394
00:49:21,431 --> 00:49:24,372
And they tell me, -

395
00:49:24,396 --> 00:49:27,338
that he was not the
best father in the world.

396
00:49:27,362 --> 00:49:30,298
But that's no excuse.

397
00:49:30,322 --> 00:49:35,269
I am not your father.
Technically, we're not related.

398
00:49:35,631 --> 00:49:40,589
But I can help you.
I can get you out of here.

399
00:49:45,514 --> 00:49:50,450
I won't ask you to betray Jake Sully.
You would never do that. You are faithful.

400
00:49:51,673 --> 00:49:55,593
And I admire loyalty.

401
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:58,571
Now take it.

402
00:49:59,275 --> 00:50:02,234
Otherwise, I have to leave
you at the back of the pack.

403
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:14,097
My heart is heavy as stone.

404
00:50:15,065 --> 00:50:20,004
Tarsem is young but wise.
It will become a strong olo'eyktan.

405
00:50:21,983 --> 00:50:23,966
The leader must die...

406
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,580
...so that the leader can be born.

407
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:34,537
Toruk makto will disappear.

408
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:39,482
People will know for sure.

409
00:51:05,681 --> 00:51:10,620
A father protects. This
is his purpose in life.

410
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:16,304
A life ends.

411
00:51:16,894 --> 00:51:18,876
Another begins.

412
00:51:32,469 --> 00:51:34,439
Oh, Tuk...

413
00:51:37,962 --> 00:51:42,887
The Sea Clans inhabit a world
apart. Thousands of islands.

414
00:51:42,911 --> 00:51:47,823
An unknown area where we
can disappear without a trace.

415
00:51:47,847 --> 00:51:49,837
Aren't we there soon?

416
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:17,487
<i><b>AWA'ATLU, A METKAYINA VILLAGE</b></i>

417
00:52:54,948 --> 00:52:57,899
Let him stay.

418
00:52:58,889 --> 00:53:00,859
Follow me.

419
00:53:01,856 --> 00:53:02,844
Tuk.

420
00:53:04,808 --> 00:53:05,814
Behave well.

421
00:53:06,798 --> 00:53:08,768
Behave well.

422
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:30,474
Take it easy.

423
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:33,465
What is that? Should it represent a tail?

424
00:53:51,486 --> 00:53:53,346
It is then too small to swim with.

425
00:53:54,237 --> 00:53:57,201
Wait, Rotxo and Ao'nung.

426
00:53:58,758 --> 00:53:59,751
Hello.

427
00:54:24,448 --> 00:54:29,365
Tonowari was the chief of the
Metkayina, the people of the reefs.

428
00:54:29,389 --> 00:54:32,365
- I see you, Tonowari.
- Jake Sully.

429
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:36,305
He was known as a tough boss.

430
00:54:39,265 --> 00:54:42,240
But it wasn't Tonowari
who worried me.

431
00:54:45,197 --> 00:54:48,142
I see you, Ron al, the
tsahik of the metkayinas.

432
00:54:48,166 --> 00:54:50,137
I see you, Ron Al.

433
00:54:52,103 --> 00:54:56,043
- What do you expect from us, Jake Sully?
- We are looking for a trip...

434
00:54:57,266 --> 00:55:01,209
- Uturu?
- Asylum for my family.

435
00:55:03,578 --> 00:55:08,502
We are reef people. You are people of the
forest. Your skills cannot be used here.

436
00:55:08,526 --> 00:55:12,472
- So we want to know yours, right?
- yes.

437
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,408
Their arms are slender.

438
00:55:19,003 --> 00:55:23,945
Their tails are weak.
You will be slow in the water.

439
00:55:26,898 --> 00:55:29,866
The kids aren't even real Na'vi.

440
00:55:31,843 --> 00:55:33,807
Yes we are.

441
00:55:36,774 --> 00:55:37,778
There's demon blood in them!

442
00:55:42,713 --> 00:55:43,707
Look here.

443
00:55:45,677 --> 00:55:49,635
I was born from the sky people
and now I'm na'vi. You can adapt.

444
00:55:50,604 --> 00:55:53,554
We will adapt.

445
00:55:53,578 --> 00:55:56,536
My husband was toruk makto.

446
00:55:57,529 --> 00:56:03,445
He led the clans to
victory over the Sky People.

447
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:09,379
Do you call it a victory
to hide among strangers?

448
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:18,183
Eywa apparently turned his
back on you, you chose one.

449
00:56:23,841 --> 00:56:29,756
You must support my companion. She has
traveled a long journey and is exhausted.

450
00:56:34,978 --> 00:56:40,887
Toruk Makto is a powerful war hero.
All the Na'vi know his story.

451
00:56:40,911 --> 00:56:44,855
But we Metkayina are not at war.

452
00:56:46,834 --> 00:56:49,772
We can't let you take the war here.

453
00:56:49,796 --> 00:56:52,739
I'm done with the war, okay?

454
00:56:52,763 --> 00:56:56,715
I just want to protect my family.

455
00:56:59,676 --> 00:57:02,634
We asked bad luck...

456
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:09,550
- Will we be fired?
- It will be fine.

457
00:57:22,323 --> 00:57:26,245
Toruk Makto and his
family are staying with us.

458
00:57:26,269 --> 00:57:32,185
Think of them as our brothers and
sisters. But they don't know the sea.

459
00:57:33,171 --> 00:57:38,092
Therefore, they will be like newborn
babies taking their first breath.

460
00:57:38,116 --> 00:57:43,067
Teach them our way of life so they
won't be ashamed of being useless.

461
00:57:45,115 --> 00:57:48,063
- So what are you saying?
- Thank you.

462
00:57:48,087 --> 00:57:49,084
Thank you.

463
00:57:50,052 --> 00:57:53,036
My son Ao'nung and my daughter
Tsireya will guide your children.

464
00:57:54,005 --> 00:57:55,969
- Why?
- It's been decided.

465
00:57:57,192 --> 00:58:00,146
Come see our village.

466
00:58:10,035 --> 00:58:11,026
This way.

467
00:58:14,964 --> 00:58:15,943
Come on, Tuk.

468
00:58:16,566 --> 00:58:18,545
It's right here.

469
00:58:26,448 --> 00:58:30,382
This is your new home.

470
00:58:30,768 --> 00:58:32,723
It depends.

471
00:58:32,748 --> 00:58:35,707
That's cool, huh?

472
00:58:48,148 --> 00:58:51,092
- Sully is, get up.
- There's a family reunion.

473
00:58:51,116 --> 00:58:53,071
- On your knees.
- Kiri.

474
00:58:53,095 --> 00:58:55,075
What?

475
00:58:57,028 --> 00:59:01,950
I need you to behave in an
exemplary manner. I'm serious.

476
00:59:01,974 --> 00:59:06,888
Learn fast, take your turn and
avoid creating trouble. Understood?

477
00:59:06,912 --> 00:59:08,885
Yes.

478
00:59:11,094 --> 00:59:15,015
I want to go home.

479
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:16,984
Oh, Tuk...

480
00:59:17,008 --> 00:59:20,955
Tuk is our home now.

481
00:59:22,855 --> 00:59:26,772
We will probably get there.

482
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:31,728
- As long as we take care of each other.
- What does dad always say?

483
00:59:31,752 --> 00:59:34,683
Sully is a fussy person.

484
00:59:34,707 --> 00:59:38,656
Yes, Sully is a maniac.
So say it with conviction.

485
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:43,079
- Sully is fussy.
- Sully is fussy.

486
00:59:53,939 --> 00:59:54,937
Come on!

487
01:01:30,765 --> 01:01:32,734
Swim with us.

488
01:02:08,435 --> 01:02:13,339
- What's wrong with them?
- They're bad at diving.

489
01:02:13,363 --> 01:02:16,334
Stop. They just have to learn it.

490
01:02:26,824 --> 01:02:31,734
- Are you OK?
- You are swimming way too fast.

491
01:02:31,971 --> 01:02:33,952
Breathe.

492
01:02:34,107 --> 01:02:38,049
You are not good at diving. You're
probably better at swinging through trees.

493
01:02:38,073 --> 01:02:42,733
- Stop that.
- We don't understand your sign language.

494
01:02:43,596 --> 01:02:46,552
- I'll probably teach you that.
- Where did Kiri go?

495
01:02:46,576 --> 01:02:49,539
- Where is she?
- Have you seen it?

496
01:03:00,407 --> 01:03:05,311
Get on board, find a seat
and don't get in the way.

497
01:03:05,335 --> 01:03:09,265
- Come on hurry up!
- The coolest.

498
01:03:09,289 --> 01:03:12,235
Stop halfway, Karl Smart.

499
01:03:12,259 --> 01:03:17,166
Listen. A transmitter is
integrated into the mask.

500
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:21,129
If you run away, I'll catch
you at zero point five -

501
01:03:21,153 --> 01:03:26,066
and gives you an
old-school finish. Understood?

502
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:29,028
- Understood?
- Yes.

503
01:03:29,052 --> 01:03:31,036
- Ready?
- Everything is ready.

504
01:03:46,446 --> 01:03:51,357
Listen carefully. Jake
Sully went into hiding.

505
01:03:51,381 --> 01:03:57,303
But we'll probably find
him and his mad lady.

506
01:03:58,308 --> 01:04:02,231
To be able to do this, we must be na'vi.

507
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:04,209
Screw too full.

508
01:04:04,233 --> 01:04:10,132
We must eat like the Na'vi, ride
like the Na'vi and think like the Na'vi.

509
01:04:10,156 --> 01:04:15,105
And first of all, we have to speak Na'vi.

510
01:04:18,058 --> 01:04:22,996
Do you call that talking Na'vi?
You sound like a three year old.

511
01:04:26,032 --> 01:04:28,006
OK, smart eye.

512
01:04:28,229 --> 01:04:32,190
You have just been promoted from
our monkey mascot to our interpreter.

513
01:04:39,706 --> 01:04:44,642
It is an illusion. If you want to live
here, you have to know how to ride.

514
01:04:45,638 --> 01:04:48,597
Carefully tie the ribbon.

515
01:04:52,543 --> 01:04:56,495
Feel his breath. Feel its strength.

516
01:04:57,781 --> 01:04:59,743
Wait here.

517
01:04:59,774 --> 01:05:03,708
- Look at his legs.
- Hold on.

518
01:05:22,476 --> 01:05:24,450
Are you all right, Wood Goblin?

519
01:05:34,331 --> 01:05:40,278
This war walker is difficult to master.
Maybe you should start with an il...

520
01:05:41,246 --> 01:05:43,225
No, this one.

521
01:05:45,518 --> 01:05:51,425
Remember that when diving, it is
important to take the right position.

522
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:57,360
I can do it.

523
01:06:22,055 --> 01:06:23,050
Yes like this.

524
01:06:24,812 --> 01:06:26,776
Calm.

525
01:07:12,344 --> 01:07:14,320
I already love it.

526
01:07:54,267 --> 01:07:57,208
breathing…

527
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:01,633
...and exhale.

528
01:08:01,657 --> 01:08:05,588
Imagine breathing in a flame.

529
01:08:05,612 --> 01:08:08,576
You have to say your heart rate.

530
01:08:09,578 --> 01:08:12,502
breathing.

531
01:08:12,526 --> 01:08:15,480
Breathe all the way down here.

532
01:08:15,504 --> 01:08:19,438
And exhale slowly.

533
01:08:20,424 --> 01:08:25,351
Lo'ak, your heart is beating fast.
Try to concentrate.

534
01:08:25,375 --> 01:08:27,358
Breathing…

535
01:08:28,325 --> 01:08:32,296
...and exhale. Clear your mind.

536
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:52,146
You learn to breathe.

537
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,011
Come on, losers!

538
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:24,833
Leave me.

539
01:09:30,952 --> 01:09:32,903
What is that?

540
01:09:32,948 --> 01:09:37,864
The Na'vi children do it with bare fists.

541
01:09:37,888 --> 01:09:41,838
- Did Sully do it the hard way?
- What do you think?

542
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:46,769
What are we doing?

543
01:09:50,723 --> 01:09:53,677
It's going to be good.

544
01:09:55,137 --> 01:09:56,132
Forward.

545
01:10:03,056 --> 01:10:05,029
It's you and me, baby.

546
01:10:17,877 --> 01:10:20,844
Did I say you have
to tie the beak first?

547
01:10:21,812 --> 01:10:22,817
Oh thank you!

548
01:10:27,743 --> 01:10:28,748
Forward!

549
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:39,423
Can you see them?

550
01:11:01,166 --> 01:11:05,103
Come on, we have to move on.

551
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:08,080
To take off.

552
01:11:14,987 --> 01:11:16,972
Yes exactly!

553
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:20,920
That's right, Colonel!

554
01:11:21,916 --> 01:11:24,864
Whose turn is it then?

555
01:11:31,794 --> 01:11:36,721
The being of water
has no beginning or end.

556
01:11:40,668 --> 01:11:44,631
The sea is around you and within you.

557
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:54,516
The sea is your home
before you were born...

558
01:11:55,505 --> 01:11:58,466
...and after your death.

559
01:12:03,397 --> 01:12:06,373
Our hearts beat in the lap of the world.

560
01:12:09,326 --> 01:12:13,283
Our breath burns in
the shadow of the abyss.

561
01:12:15,245 --> 01:12:20,185
The sea gives and the sea takes.

562
01:12:23,149 --> 01:12:25,144
Water binds everything together.

563
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:30,077
Life and death.

564
01:12:32,830 --> 01:12:35,795
Darkness to light.

565
01:12:37,423 --> 01:12:41,369
- I understood! Tsireya!
- You did it.

566
01:12:57,647 --> 01:13:00,613
They let us breathe underwater.

567
01:13:43,695 --> 01:13:45,643
What is she doing?

568
01:13:45,668 --> 01:13:49,614
- No idea.
- She's just looking at the sand.

569
01:13:50,617 --> 01:13:52,551
What did you say?

570
01:13:52,575 --> 01:13:55,532
Are you some kind of deformity?

571
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:58,498
Are you a freak?

572
01:14:00,491 --> 01:14:01,483
No.

573
01:14:02,454 --> 01:14:05,406
Are you sure?
You are not a true na'vi.

574
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:08,386
Look at those hands. See.

575
01:14:10,962 --> 01:14:12,917
Skrid, fish face.

576
01:14:12,941 --> 01:14:17,866
- Another four-finger deformity.
- Look at his little baby tail.

577
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:20,828
- Leave us!
- It's not normal.

578
01:14:20,852 --> 01:14:24,788
Look at his tail. This is very cute.

579
01:14:25,781 --> 01:14:28,728
You heard her. Leave them alone.

580
01:14:28,752 --> 01:14:31,679
Big brother...

581
01:14:31,703 --> 01:14:35,652
Walk with you. Now.

582
01:14:41,213 --> 01:14:48,113
Sensitive. And from now
on, please respect my sister.

583
01:14:51,089 --> 01:14:53,057
Has come.

584
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:56,984
Goodbye!

585
01:14:57,008 --> 01:15:00,960
They are perverts, the whole family.

586
01:15:01,959 --> 01:15:04,919
- Lo'ak...
- Calm down bro.

587
01:15:07,876 --> 01:15:11,837
Yes, my hand is weird.
I am a deformity.

588
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:18,728
But it can do something
cool. First, I tie it very tight.

589
01:15:18,752 --> 01:15:20,715
As well...

590
01:15:24,667 --> 01:15:28,617
It's called a stroke, weak.
You will never touch my sister again.

591
01:15:39,494 --> 01:15:41,452
Stop!

592
01:15:41,476 --> 01:15:43,445
Stop that!

593
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:47,385
It's too stupid!

594
01:15:49,379 --> 01:15:52,310
Oh, my tail!

595
01:15:52,334 --> 01:15:57,281
My ear! Let it go! He's ripping my ear off!

596
01:16:02,202 --> 01:16:06,132
- What did I ask you?
- To avoid creating trouble.

597
01:16:06,156 --> 01:16:09,111
- It was my fault.
- You don't have to take out the trash for him.

598
01:16:09,135 --> 01:16:13,073
Ao'nung called Kiri a deformity.

599
01:16:17,629 --> 01:16:22,560
Say sorry to Ao'nung.
He's the chief's son.

600
01:16:23,554 --> 01:16:27,506
I don't care how, as long
as you make peace with him.

601
01:16:34,426 --> 01:16:37,390
- What did the others look like?
- Worse.

602
01:16:38,372 --> 01:16:40,360
- Good.
- Much worse.

603
01:16:41,328 --> 01:16:42,331
Leave.

604
01:16:54,176 --> 01:16:56,168
What's wrong?

605
01:16:57,136 --> 01:17:01,105
Nothing. I'm doing well.
Why shouldn't I?

606
01:17:08,995 --> 01:17:12,933
Why can't I be
like everyone else?

607
01:17:12,957 --> 01:17:14,933
Kir...

608
01:17:19,091 --> 01:17:22,064
What is the tree runner doing here?

609
01:17:25,011 --> 01:17:27,976
Sorry, I hit you plenty of times.

610
01:17:33,918 --> 01:17:36,876
Lets be friends.

611
01:17:37,872 --> 01:17:42,813
Join us for a hunt outside the
reef. This is where the men hunt.

612
01:17:44,769 --> 01:17:48,721
- I must not.
- I asked the wrong brother.

613
01:17:49,715 --> 01:17:51,689
Let's do it.

614
01:18:05,519 --> 01:18:06,523
Go on!

615
01:18:16,389 --> 01:18:18,358
Stay tuned, forest troll!

616
01:18:22,308 --> 01:18:26,266
WOODEN BREAD SLICERS

617
01:18:33,186 --> 01:18:37,126
- You survived.
- It was great!

618
01:18:38,119 --> 01:18:40,111
Come on, I know a good place.

619
01:18:52,938 --> 01:18:53,940
Call the fish.

620
01:19:09,748 --> 01:19:11,708
What a fool.

621
01:19:33,056 --> 01:19:36,014
Guys?

622
01:19:38,288 --> 01:19:40,253
Ao'nung!

623
01:19:40,277 --> 01:19:42,257
It's not funny!

624
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:55,349
Ao'nung!

625
01:23:30,066 --> 01:23:31,065
Holy shit.

626
01:24:00,683 --> 01:24:02,672
You are a tulkun.

627
01:24:04,653 --> 01:24:07,608
You saved my life. Thank you.

628
01:24:09,572 --> 01:24:10,573
Thank you.

629
01:24:16,507 --> 01:24:19,457
I have no idea what you said.

630
01:24:25,392 --> 01:24:27,360
They hurt you.

631
01:24:29,344 --> 01:24:32,283
I try to remove it.

632
01:24:32,307 --> 01:24:34,287
Trust me.

633
01:25:07,876 --> 01:25:09,839
Friends?

634
01:25:12,807 --> 01:25:15,767
Yes we are friends.

635
01:25:19,724 --> 01:25:20,716
Bridge!

636
01:26:30,848 --> 01:26:32,835
I'm sorry.

637
01:27:13,456 --> 01:27:17,423
What's the matter, honey?
Do you miss Spider?

638
01:27:20,377 --> 01:27:24,317
Yes, but that's not the case.

639
01:27:26,303 --> 01:27:31,212
OK. What is it then?

640
01:27:31,236 --> 01:27:35,171
I can smell it, dad.

641
01:27:35,195 --> 01:27:38,151
- Tag who?
- Eva.

642
01:27:43,086 --> 01:27:48,021
I can hear his breathing.
I can hear his heart beating.

643
01:27:48,045 --> 01:27:50,976
She is so close.

644
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,983
She is here...

645
01:27:54,955 --> 01:27:57,919
...like a word that's right on the tongue.

646
01:28:02,853 --> 01:28:05,815
I know you think I'm crazy.

647
01:28:08,062 --> 01:28:10,038
You're not crazy, honey.

648
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,901
So what does Eywa's heartbeat sound like?

649
01:28:21,845 --> 01:28:24,798
Powerful.

650
01:28:30,736 --> 01:28:33,690
Tell him what you told me.

651
01:28:38,622 --> 01:28:40,617
Do you like stargazing?

652
01:28:43,559 --> 01:28:45,536
My father came from a star.

653
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:48,518
The one right there.

654
01:28:51,475 --> 01:28:54,431
- Lo'ak!
- Now I'm on it.

655
01:28:57,395 --> 01:28:59,890
We'll see each other again.

656
01:29:17,165 --> 01:29:21,108
- The boy has been found!
- The Sully boy has been found!

657
01:29:30,001 --> 01:29:31,964
Let me see you.

658
01:29:31,988 --> 01:29:36,908
He is unharmed. It's just a few scratches.

659
01:29:38,895 --> 01:29:42,854
Give me the strength not to
tear my eyes out on my son.

660
01:29:44,810 --> 01:29:48,774
No. My son knew not
to take him off the reef.

661
01:29:51,329 --> 01:29:52,332
The fault is his.

662
01:29:54,307 --> 01:29:55,283
Ok.

663
01:29:56,207 --> 01:30:01,148
No. It's not Ao'nung's
fault. It was my idea.

664
01:30:01,516 --> 01:30:05,468
Ao'nung actually
tried to talk me out of it.

665
01:30:06,178 --> 01:30:09,119
- Lo'ak.
- Sorry.

666
01:30:09,177 --> 01:30:11,150
Go on.

667
01:30:13,374 --> 01:30:15,346
I go.

668
01:30:17,332 --> 01:30:21,274
- Is it true?
- But what did you have in mind?

669
01:30:24,246 --> 01:30:27,188
You said yourself that I
should be friends with them.

670
01:30:27,212 --> 01:30:32,143
I don't want to hear about it.
You have shamed the family.

671
01:30:34,119 --> 01:30:37,102
- Can I leave now?
- Next time, I'll tie a knot in your tail.

672
01:30:38,070 --> 01:30:42,036
- It's understood?
- Yes. Lima Charlie.

673
01:30:52,127 --> 01:30:57,040
- Where have you been?
- You should keep an eye on your brother.

674
01:30:57,064 --> 01:30:59,040
Sorry.

675
01:31:02,997 --> 01:31:04,975
Why did you speak for me?

676
01:31:05,944 --> 01:31:09,900
Because I know what it's
like to be a big disappointment.

677
01:31:11,875 --> 01:31:15,808
I would have loved to be there.
The sea gave you a gift.

678
01:31:16,132 --> 01:31:22,032
The tulkuns haven't arrived
yet and no tulkun swims alone.

679
01:31:22,056 --> 01:31:24,009
This one did.

680
01:31:24,033 --> 01:31:28,957
He was missing his only fin.
The one on the left was just a stump.

681
01:31:28,981 --> 01:31:31,925
Payakan. This is Payakan.

682
01:31:31,949 --> 01:31:35,865
- Who is Payakan?
- An unruly young bull.

683
01:31:35,889 --> 01:31:38,840
He's an outcast and he's missing a fin.

684
01:31:38,864 --> 01:31:45,743
- He was supposed to be a killer.
- He killed Na'vi and Tulkun.

685
01:31:45,767 --> 01:31:49,725
- Far to the south.
- He's not a killer.

686
01:31:50,714 --> 01:31:54,645
- You are lucky to have survived.
- Well, he saved my life.

687
01:31:54,669 --> 01:31:58,596
- He is my friend.
- My little brother...

688
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:03,550
The mighty warrior who fought
a killer tulkun and survived.

689
01:32:04,544 --> 01:32:07,477
You don't listen.

690
01:32:07,501 --> 01:32:11,447
- I listen.
- Lo'ak, come back.

691
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:13,686
Payakan!

692
01:32:15,645 --> 01:32:16,648
Payakan!

693
01:32:18,616 --> 01:32:20,588
Payakan!

694
01:32:28,492 --> 01:32:30,467
Happy to see you.

695
01:32:32,452 --> 01:32:35,418
Why are you excluded? What happened?

696
01:32:36,405 --> 01:32:39,364
It's too painful.

697
01:32:40,363 --> 01:32:46,271
I trust you. You can trust me.

698
01:33:30,738 --> 01:33:32,715
Oh, that sucks.

699
01:33:34,170 --> 01:34:13,832

<font color="#64ffe7">--- MARIB ---</font>

700
01:34:14,721 --> 01:34:16,697
Faster!

701
01:34:52,223 --> 01:34:54,201
So here we are.

702
01:35:00,122 --> 01:35:05,058
The Vig des Ancêtres
is our holiest place.

703
01:35:10,982 --> 01:35:13,948
Eclipse is the best
time to be here.

704
01:35:26,799 --> 01:35:30,745
Here it is. The Spirit Tree.

705
01:36:36,946 --> 01:36:39,885
My beautiful daughter.

706
01:36:39,916 --> 01:36:41,867
Hi Mom.

707
01:36:41,891 --> 01:36:44,861
It's nice to see you.
But you look worried.

708
01:36:51,766 --> 01:36:54,745
Honey, it'll be fine.

709
01:37:02,628 --> 01:37:07,570
- What's wrong?
- Why am I different?

710
01:37:08,569 --> 01:37:11,533
What does the Al-Mother want from me?

711
01:37:14,493 --> 01:37:17,466
Who was my father?

712
01:37:20,413 --> 01:37:23,376
Oh, mine...

713
01:37:46,103 --> 01:37:48,074
- Go on!
- Kiri!

714
01:37:50,275 --> 01:37:52,240
Kiri!

715
01:37:54,221 --> 01:37:58,144
- What's wrong?
- She had a seizure.

716
01:37:59,368 --> 01:38:01,356
Is she breathing?

717
01:38:03,789 --> 01:38:07,748
- Take her back to the village.
- Let's go!

718
01:38:23,549 --> 01:38:26,497
- Happy to see you.
- Neteyam, keep them away.

719
01:38:26,521 --> 01:38:29,454
- How is she?
- Still unconscious.

720
01:38:29,478 --> 01:38:32,430
No bleeding, no breakage.

721
01:38:32,454 --> 01:38:35,422
The lack of oxygen did
not damage the brain.

722
01:38:40,356 --> 01:38:43,304
But there is interictal
activity in the frontal lobe.

723
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:48,241
She must have had a seizure.
We can eliminate toxins.

724
01:38:48,265 --> 01:38:53,204
- I'm not needed here.
- You are tzahik.

725
01:38:54,189 --> 01:38:58,122
- Delete remedies.
- Outside! You did nothing!

726
01:38:58,146 --> 01:39:03,068
- Come on, let's take a break.
- Let me take the drop.

727
01:39:04,059 --> 01:39:05,061
Tuktirey.

728
01:39:12,962 --> 01:39:17,870
She said she could smell
Eywa and hear her heart beating.

729
01:39:17,894 --> 01:39:21,815
- It's a typical frontal lobe epilepsy.
- Epilepsy?

730
01:39:21,839 --> 01:39:25,807
We see visions and experience religious
ecstasy like the one she described.

731
01:39:35,883 --> 01:39:38,834
The association with the
spirit tree must have triggered it.

732
01:39:38,858 --> 01:39:42,779
Don't let her do that again.

733
01:39:42,803 --> 01:39:43,802
Never?

734
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:49,727
Jake, if she has another
seizure underwater, she could die.

735
01:39:59,603 --> 01:40:03,545
Kiri, you're awake.

736
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:15,413
Kiri, sweet child. My lovely daughter.

737
01:40:16,381 --> 01:40:19,345
Try this one: "I see you."

738
01:40:25,502 --> 01:40:27,469
I said it too.

739
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:31,432
No way. Ngaati.

740
01:40:32,421 --> 01:40:35,384
OK, it's coming out the nose.

741
01:40:36,352 --> 01:40:40,325
Chief, one of the patrols
picked up a gunship on radar.

742
01:40:41,984 --> 01:40:44,946
- Where?
- Above the sea, 400 km to the north.

743
01:40:46,936 --> 01:40:48,904
Hold.

744
01:40:50,877 --> 01:40:54,809
The signal disappeared offshore.

745
01:40:54,833 --> 01:41:00,736
But if you continue the route, you
will come across this archipelago.

746
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:04,720
There are hundreds of
islands with countless villages.

747
01:41:05,689 --> 01:41:10,628
It's him. Give me vases and
I'll come home with his scalp.

748
01:41:22,485 --> 01:41:25,449
- We will be airlifted.
- Captain.

749
01:41:32,373 --> 01:41:36,314
- Stop the engines.
- Yes.

750
01:41:55,105 --> 01:41:58,035
Are you Score by?

751
01:41:58,059 --> 01:42:00,999
Are you the bad ass taking my ship?

752
01:42:02,223 --> 01:42:05,161
It's me.

753
01:42:05,185 --> 01:42:09,115
The target is the whole archipelago.

754
01:42:09,139 --> 01:42:14,056
I've never been there. You
know the waters. Who lives here?

755
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:18,009
Mainly metkayinas, about 50 villages.

756
01:42:18,033 --> 01:42:19,984
Who are you?

757
01:42:20,008 --> 01:42:24,914
Ian Garvin, marine biologist.

758
01:42:24,938 --> 01:42:27,915
If there are 100 villages,
we search them all.

759
01:42:28,907 --> 01:42:35,806
I hunt tulkuns. This is what
we do. I have quotas to respect.

760
01:42:36,794 --> 01:42:40,757
I'm polite the first time. So it's over.

761
01:42:43,707 --> 01:42:47,637
If you can't avoid it, enter it.

762
01:42:47,661 --> 01:42:51,608
- All men to their posts!
- Hello, no pills.

763
01:42:52,606 --> 01:42:55,570
- Rudder wires, speed.
- Yes.

764
01:43:06,634 --> 01:43:10,598
- What was that?
- What is going on?

765
01:43:12,580 --> 01:43:17,517
The Tulkuns are back!
Our brothers and sisters are back!

766
01:43:28,366 --> 01:43:33,306
Their endless cycle of wandering
had brought the Tulkuns home.

767
01:43:38,246 --> 01:43:39,228
Kiri!

768
01:43:39,252 --> 01:43:44,172
- Kiri, come!
- Tuk, leave me alone.

769
01:43:45,176 --> 01:43:48,143
- What do you want?
- See!

770
01:43:58,130 --> 01:44:02,058
Let's meet them.

771
01:44:02,089 --> 01:44:04,074
There is my soul mate.

772
01:45:00,383 --> 01:45:03,345
My sister, I see you.

773
01:45:04,327 --> 01:45:06,316
I see you and I'm happy.

774
01:45:12,243 --> 01:45:16,165
Your son is handsome.

775
01:45:16,189 --> 01:45:19,148
Thank you. How is your little one?

776
01:45:20,134 --> 01:45:23,087
My little one is strong.

777
01:45:25,074 --> 01:45:26,072
I met a boy.

778
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:30,988
Now stories had to be told about
the time they had been apart.

779
01:45:31,012 --> 01:45:33,971
About death and births.

780
01:45:34,963 --> 01:45:38,898
About old friends and new love.

781
01:45:53,719 --> 01:45:56,680
<i><b>TA'UNUI VILLAGE</b></i>

782
01:46:00,647 --> 01:46:02,602
Keep calm.

783
01:46:02,626 --> 01:46:06,551
We are looking for weapons,
radios, technical equipment.

784
01:46:06,575 --> 01:46:10,500
On your knees! Can you see it here?

785
01:46:10,524 --> 01:46:12,488
Shut up!

786
01:46:15,452 --> 01:46:21,397
We know that this man resides
somewhere here on the islands. Is he here?

787
01:46:22,365 --> 01:46:28,281
Our tribe lives in isolation.
The man in the photo comes from the forest.

788
01:46:28,305 --> 01:46:33,223
- What's he saying?
- That the people of the forest never come here.

789
01:46:33,247 --> 01:46:36,204
I don't buy it.

790
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:44,115
He must search in the forest
if he wants to find this man.

791
01:46:47,967 --> 01:46:48,970
They do not know anything.

792
01:46:51,926 --> 01:46:54,876
Shoot this animal.

793
01:46:57,085 --> 01:46:59,053
What do you do?

794
01:47:07,347 --> 01:47:10,281
Take it easy.

795
01:47:10,305 --> 01:47:14,253
Are your ears working now?
Now you have seen what they can do.

796
01:47:16,238 --> 01:47:21,153
Jake Sulley. Power of Toruk!

797
01:47:21,177 --> 01:47:22,551
He does not know anything.

798
01:47:22,576 --> 01:47:24,543
Kill her.

799
01:47:27,709 --> 01:47:29,660
Stop! Stop!

800
01:47:29,684 --> 01:47:35,583
Cut it out of cardboard for him. If he
doesn't expose Sully, we'll kill the tsahik.

801
01:47:35,607 --> 01:47:40,538
No, I refuse. I don't
want to be part of that.

802
01:47:41,538 --> 01:47:44,500
They do not know anything!

803
01:47:50,419 --> 01:47:52,383
Do we really have to kill her?

804
01:47:52,407 --> 01:47:58,319
You don't have to do this. What
you are doing here is so wrong!

805
01:47:59,389 --> 01:48:01,365
Do not.

806
01:48:05,544 --> 01:48:09,468
- Burn the huts.
- Set it on fire.

807
01:48:09,492 --> 01:48:11,464
Set it all on fire!

808
01:48:24,299 --> 01:48:29,229
- Forgive me. I did not know.
- You have to stop the madness!

809
01:48:29,253 --> 01:48:34,159
- Forgive me.
- We slipped.

810
01:48:34,183 --> 01:48:36,177
Do not touch me!

811
01:48:37,145 --> 01:48:39,141
Go on. Sit down!

812
01:49:04,511 --> 01:49:07,469
- What's wrong?
- The people of heaven.

813
01:49:07,493 --> 01:49:14,388
They're looking for you down south. They
have a human boy with them who speaks Na'vi.

814
01:49:18,342 --> 01:49:21,318
- Did they kill anyone?
- Not yet.

815
01:49:23,879 --> 01:49:28,834
They threaten to do so, but no one
will reveal where you are. On my order.

816
01:49:36,729 --> 01:49:42,643
We must cast out this demon.
Catch him and kill him.

817
01:49:42,667 --> 01:49:45,605
We have to think about it.

818
01:49:45,629 --> 01:49:52,506
If we attack Quaritch, they'll
follow us here with all their might.

819
01:49:53,130 --> 01:49:56,082
So what do we do?

820
01:49:56,106 --> 01:50:01,038
We are looking for toruk
makto! Did he come here?

821
01:50:04,990 --> 01:50:07,967
- It's useless.
- They are silent as the grave.

822
01:50:10,136 --> 01:50:16,074
If we continue, he will run
away. We have to attract it.

823
01:50:25,553 --> 01:50:29,494
I'm finished. I have
quotas to respect.

824
01:50:29,218 --> 01:50:32,186
Do you want to hunt? Then we hunt.

825
01:50:32,555 --> 01:50:35,120
Well not here? There
are too many villages here.

826
01:50:35,145 --> 01:50:37,387
No no no.

827
01:50:37,894 --> 01:50:42,803
They don't understand the
community bond between the Tulkuns -

828
01:50:42,827 --> 01:50:45,783
and the Havna'vi. It would
be like killing their family.

829
01:50:45,807 --> 01:50:49,722
If we hunt here, the
savages will come after us.

830
01:50:49,746 --> 01:50:53,709
Exactly. A definitely savage.

831
01:51:03,571 --> 01:51:06,532
I know what you're feeling.

832
01:51:08,509 --> 01:51:11,485
I also feel completely alone.

833
01:51:13,447 --> 01:51:17,399
Tell me. Why were you expelled?

834
01:53:39,714 --> 01:53:44,634
I'm sorry. It hurts me terribly.

835
01:53:48,961 --> 01:53:51,925
It's OK.

836
01:54:04,611 --> 01:54:07,544
You allowed it.

837
01:54:07,568 --> 01:54:11,526
You allowed him to
bond with the outcast.

838
01:54:13,511 --> 01:54:17,458
Tsireya... You disappoint me, my daughter.

839
01:54:19,419 --> 01:54:23,357
And you are the son of a great warrior.
You are better than that.

840
01:54:23,381 --> 01:54:28,305
Payakan saved my life.
They don't know him.

841
01:54:29,229 --> 01:54:32,155
Sit.

842
01:54:32,179 --> 01:54:34,150
Sit.

843
01:54:35,479 --> 01:54:37,455
Sit!

844
01:54:41,084 --> 01:54:44,996
Listen to my words, my boy.

845
01:54:45,020 --> 01:54:49,945
At the time of the first songs, the
tulkuns fought among themselves -

846
01:54:49,969 --> 01:54:53,929
to gain ground and take revenge.

847
01:54:54,897 --> 01:54:58,843
But they realized that
killing, justified or not, -

848
01:54:58,867 --> 01:55:03,771
just leads to more murders.

849
01:55:03,795 --> 01:55:06,743
It was therefore forbidden to kill.

850
01:55:06,767 --> 01:55:11,674
This is the tulkun way of life.

851
01:55:11,698 --> 01:55:17,596
Payakan is a killer and
therefore an outcast.

852
01:55:17,620 --> 01:55:22,538
- Sorry, but you're wrong.
- Lo'ak, you speak olo'eyktan.

853
01:55:22,562 --> 01:55:25,536
Well, that's good!

854
01:55:28,495 --> 01:55:30,469
I know what I know.

855
01:55:33,424 --> 01:55:35,421
So it's good.

856
01:55:36,389 --> 01:55:38,380
I will take care of him.

857
01:55:44,290 --> 01:55:46,286
The storm will probably dissipate.

858
01:55:47,254 --> 01:55:51,186
Lo'ak, I saw something today.

859
01:55:51,210 --> 01:55:55,137
I saw a forest boy chosen by a tulkun.

860
01:55:55,161 --> 01:55:57,130
I am very proud of you.

861
01:55:57,154 --> 01:56:01,076
It wasn't Payakan who
killed the boys. I saw it.

862
01:56:01,700 --> 01:56:05,625
The demon ship killed his mother,
so he gathered the young bulls -

863
01:56:05,649 --> 01:56:10,565
and the Reef Boys to attack
the ship, and they were all killed.

864
01:56:10,589 --> 01:56:14,525
But people from heaven,
not from him. It's not a killer.

865
01:56:14,549 --> 01:56:18,473
According to the law of the Tulkuns,
he is responsible for their death.

866
01:56:18,497 --> 01:56:23,433
Will he have to pay for the rest of his
life? He knows what he did was wrong.

867
01:56:25,405 --> 01:56:28,378
- We need to tell my father...
- No. My father is furious.

868
01:56:29,346 --> 01:56:33,317
- Your father will understand.
- Nope. He does not understand anything.

869
01:56:34,285 --> 01:56:38,258
The whole clan hates me. Demon
blood, stranger. That's all they see.

870
01:56:45,158 --> 01:56:46,162
I see you.

871
01:56:51,085 --> 01:56:54,052
You are the brother of a tulkun.

872
01:56:56,021 --> 01:56:57,030
You are one of us now.

873
01:57:14,794 --> 01:57:18,725
- Did you find the mother?
- And the calf. 4000 meters.

874
01:57:18,749 --> 01:57:22,708
- Hull in the water!
- Yes. Carrier plan activated.

875
01:57:46,316 --> 01:57:49,263
Submarine teams, two minutes!

876
01:57:49,287 --> 01:57:52,230
Batten the hatches! Hurry up!

877
01:57:52,254 --> 01:57:56,213
The crews to their boats!
Let's make some dates.

878
01:57:58,171 --> 01:58:02,124
People, get off the ropes!

879
01:58:07,071 --> 01:58:09,040
Boats in the water!

880
01:58:13,009 --> 01:58:14,973
Go!

881
01:58:25,836 --> 01:58:26,838
To take off!

882
01:58:52,522 --> 01:58:56,465
Depth charges ready. Dude, dude, dude!

883
01:59:19,408 --> 01:59:22,334
What are they doing?

884
01:59:22,358 --> 01:59:26,289
These are echolocation
sensors with which they navigate.

885
01:59:26,313 --> 01:59:29,289
They keep them afloat
so they don't go deaf.

886
01:59:30,257 --> 01:59:34,227
Picadors, far from you!

887
01:59:50,035 --> 01:59:53,989
They isolate the cow from the
herd using the sound cannon.

888
01:59:54,957 --> 01:59:59,875
They go after the mother because the
calf is slow and she does not leave it.

889
02:00:00,499 --> 02:00:04,440
- Are they resisting?
- No, they never raise a palm.

890
02:00:04,464 --> 02:00:10,354
But they are sailing demons.
Submarine teams, go!

891
02:00:10,378 --> 02:00:12,356
Cut.

892
02:00:15,328 --> 02:00:17,296
Cut.

893
02:00:22,230 --> 02:00:26,167
- We have the lady.
- Target in sight. Harpoons ready.

894
02:00:26,191 --> 02:00:28,177
Then we go.

895
02:00:29,145 --> 02:00:33,105
We attack from below,
where their armor is cracked.

896
02:00:36,973 --> 02:00:40,934
- Alright, that's all now.
- Really bring me closer.

897
02:00:44,869 --> 02:00:47,811
- Hold it steady.
- Arm the eater.

898
02:00:47,835 --> 02:00:50,798
- Armed.
- Fire the eater.

899
02:01:36,108 --> 02:01:39,080
2 ready. Arm the eater. Guy!

900
02:01:43,038 --> 02:01:45,996
- Perfect match.
- Pull the devil.

901
02:01:46,987 --> 02:01:51,919
- Boo yaa!
- 3-6, you owe a bajer.

902
02:01:56,775 --> 02:02:01,692
The bags sink it and
pull it to the surface.

903
02:02:01,716 --> 02:02:06,640
Bring me closer! Very close. 30 meters.

904
02:02:06,664 --> 02:02:08,641
Pomegranate Harpoon.

905
02:02:09,610 --> 02:02:12,554
10 meters. Let me in all the way.

906
02:02:12,578 --> 02:02:17,521
Keep the boat stable! Wait wait.

907
02:02:19,489 --> 02:02:20,480
The line turns!

908
02:02:26,421 --> 02:02:29,370
Keep your hat and ponytail on.

909
02:02:41,025 --> 02:02:43,984
- Full power back!
- Yes.

910
02:02:50,626 --> 02:02:52,619
Hold it!

911
02:02:55,582 --> 02:03:02,498
She has a grenade harpoon in her chest,
but she continues to swim. Beautiful.

912
02:04:15,595 --> 02:04:20,522
We can only access the gland from
below, so we drill through the palate -

913
02:04:20,546 --> 02:04:23,504
and in the brain.

914
02:04:27,691 --> 02:04:31,030
They are very intelligent.
Probably smarter than us.

915
02:04:31,091 --> 02:04:34,033
- No smarter than me.
- Then the bar is set low.

916
02:04:34,058 --> 02:04:36,999
I'm the one with the harpoon.

917
02:04:37,023 --> 02:04:38,011
Oh yes.

918
02:04:49,479 --> 02:04:54,397
- How do you know they're smarter than us?
- They have more neurons and nerve fibers.

919
02:04:55,460 --> 02:04:59,417
They are not only smarter,
but also deeply emotional.

920
02:05:00,561 --> 02:05:02,543
More spiritual.

921
02:05:05,503 --> 02:05:09,426
The area here corresponds
to our emotional center, -

922
02:05:09,450 --> 02:05:12,413
but is proportionally much larger.

923
02:05:14,600 --> 02:05:18,540
They have music, philosophy, mathematics -

924
02:05:18,564 --> 02:05:21,494
and a complex language.

925
02:05:21,518 --> 02:05:26,454
- Alright, that's all now.
- Bring on the horrors.

926
02:05:30,419 --> 02:05:34,388
- So it's the hops?
- Exactly. Amrita.

927
02:05:36,523 --> 02:05:43,400
Unfortunately for them,
dirt can stop human aging.

928
02:05:43,424 --> 02:05:44,430
Totally.

929
02:05:47,296 --> 02:05:53,201
The most valuable raw
material known to mankind.

930
02:05:53,225 --> 02:05:59,121
This little container is
worth about 80 million.

931
02:05:59,145 --> 02:06:01,096
Vulture!

932
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:04,076
Don't do this. It's never funny.

933
02:06:04,100 --> 02:06:08,050
Amrita funds everything
here on Pandora now.

934
02:06:09,034 --> 02:06:13,967
- Even your research, Dr. G.
- That's why I drink.

935
02:06:15,933 --> 02:06:19,897
Are you taking anything
else? Is the rest just wasted?

936
02:06:20,895 --> 02:06:24,811
Empty the bags and let it flow.

937
02:06:24,835 --> 02:06:28,795
No, leave the bags alone.
They need to know it was us.

938
02:06:29,764 --> 02:06:32,748
I need extra payment
to serve as bait.

939
02:07:07,304 --> 02:07:10,270
Her name is Ro'a.

940
02:07:11,273 --> 02:07:14,234
She was my soul mate.

941
02:07:17,191 --> 02:07:19,182
She composed songs.

942
02:07:20,150 --> 02:07:24,080
She was very popular. We sang together.

943
02:07:24,104 --> 02:07:30,048
She waited many breeding cycles to
have a calf. The clan cheered her on.

944
02:07:33,984 --> 02:07:36,946
What's going on, Tonowari?

945
02:07:37,948 --> 02:07:40,900
What happens?

946
02:07:59,254 --> 02:08:05,179
My spiritual sister and her child were
murdered by the people of heaven.

947
02:08:07,377 --> 02:08:13,293
The war has come to us. We knew
our tulkun family was being hunted, -

948
02:08:13,917 --> 02:08:18,854
but it happened far from here.
Now it is happening!

949
02:08:22,794 --> 02:08:26,717
You must understand how
the people of heaven think.

950
02:08:26,741 --> 02:08:29,694
- They don't care about the balance of life.
- They can execute us!

951
02:08:29,718 --> 02:08:31,671
Now listen to him.

952
02:08:31,695 --> 02:08:36,579
This is just the beginning.
Tell the Tulkuns to flee.

953
02:08:37,011 --> 02:08:38,971
Say they have to run away.

954
02:08:38,995 --> 02:08:40,977
Escape?

955
02:08:41,945 --> 02:08:45,875
You have lived among us,
but you have learned nothing.

956
02:08:45,899 --> 02:08:48,848
We will fight for our brothers and sisters!

957
02:08:48,872 --> 02:08:50,846
No no no.

958
02:08:51,831 --> 02:08:55,795
If you attack them,
they will eliminate you.

959
02:08:56,763 --> 02:08:58,759
They will destroy everything you hold dear.

960
02:08:59,727 --> 02:09:02,684
Listen to my words! Listen to my words!

961
02:09:02,708 --> 02:09:05,644
Keep calm!

962
02:09:05,668 --> 02:09:09,612
Now listen to my
father. He tells the truth.

963
02:09:19,416 --> 02:09:22,359
Tell the tulkuns, -

964
02:09:22,383 --> 02:09:27,309
that if they are hit by such a
person, they are destined to die.

965
02:09:29,276 --> 02:09:33,212
Call me and I'll shut him up.

966
02:09:33,236 --> 02:09:37,200
Saving their lives is the
only thing that matters, isn't it?

967
02:09:40,144 --> 02:09:42,120
To save your family.

968
02:09:53,992 --> 02:09:55,970
Notify the interpreters.

969
02:09:56,938 --> 02:09:58,935
Off, off.

970
02:10:02,874 --> 02:10:05,814
We must resume the fight.

971
02:10:05,838 --> 02:10:08,808
MaJake... I won't stay here.

972
02:10:09,799 --> 02:10:15,724
They just want us to strike again.
They don't hunt tulkuns. They hunt us.

973
02:10:30,532 --> 02:10:33,512
- You're not going anywhere, little brother.
- I have to warn Payakan.

974
02:10:34,480 --> 02:10:37,432
Zero. You stay here, skxawng.

975
02:10:37,456 --> 02:10:40,397
He is an outcast. No
one else will tell him.

976
02:10:40,421 --> 02:10:44,375
Brother, why do you have
to make everything so hard?

977
02:10:46,343 --> 02:10:53,232
You mean why can't I be perfect
like you? The perfect soldier.

978
02:10:53,256 --> 02:10:57,183
I'm not you, okay?

979
02:10:57,207 --> 02:11:01,172
I am not you. He
is my brother. I do.

980
02:11:02,140 --> 02:11:06,085
Is he your brother? No, I'm your brother.

981
02:11:06,109 --> 02:11:08,048
Lo'ak!

982
02:11:08,072 --> 02:11:10,029
Leave me.

983
02:11:10,053 --> 02:11:14,001
Lo'ak! He wants to go to Payakan.

984
02:11:25,852 --> 02:11:26,841
To come back!

985
02:11:29,321 --> 02:11:32,260
- There's Lo'ak.
- Lo'ak!

986
02:11:32,298 --> 02:11:35,257
- He wants to find Payakan.
- Wait for us.

987
02:11:36,263 --> 02:11:38,226
Hold.

988
02:11:46,128 --> 02:11:51,072
All men at their posts.
Come on, there's money to be won!

989
02:11:57,991 --> 02:11:59,972
Payakan! Brother!

990
02:12:00,940 --> 02:12:01,928
Lo'ak!

991
02:12:03,909 --> 02:12:05,892
- Lo'ak!
- Expect!

992
02:12:08,845 --> 02:12:10,829
What's wrong?

993
02:12:11,816 --> 02:12:13,764
Shit!

994
02:12:13,788 --> 02:12:17,736
Take it easy. I take it off.

995
02:12:23,676 --> 02:12:25,637
Shit!

996
02:12:27,620 --> 02:12:28,589
Lo'ak!

997
02:12:28,613 --> 02:12:32,572
Brother, help me! The boat is approaching!

998
02:12:35,515 --> 02:12:36,512
Go on!

999
02:12:38,493 --> 02:12:40,435
Go brother.

1000
02:12:40,459 --> 02:12:44,393
Summon the father! Just do it!

1001
02:12:44,417 --> 02:12:48,344
- Just do it!
- They will However, do you hear me?

1002
02:12:48,368 --> 02:12:51,310
- Did you see where they went?
- Outside the reef.

1003
02:12:51,334 --> 02:12:53,292
- Lo'ak?
- Sheep!

1004
02:12:53,316 --> 02:12:57,272
We are with a tulkun
who is attacked by a ship.

1005
02:12:58,258 --> 02:13:01,191
- It's 2 km away.
- Who is with you?

1006
02:13:01,215 --> 02:13:04,161
All of us, at the Trois Frères cliffs.

1007
02:13:05,685 --> 02:13:09,639
Hide and don't attack.
It's understood? We are on the way.

1008
02:13:10,007 --> 02:13:12,003
- Yes.
- It's getting closer!

1009
02:13:12,971 --> 02:13:13,966
Shoot!

1010
02:13:14,954 --> 02:13:19,878
Children are attacked. They defend
a tulkun. Your children are there too.

1011
02:13:19,902 --> 02:13:22,834
- The demon ship?
- Yes!

1012
02:13:22,858 --> 02:13:25,816
To arms! Sound the alarm!

1013
02:13:28,785 --> 02:13:31,752
- You better stay.
- I roll!

1014
02:14:21,137 --> 02:14:24,109
Submarines, batten down
the hatches! Two minutes!

1015
02:14:31,026 --> 02:14:35,953
- Ao'nung!
- Hurry up brother!

1016
02:14:39,129 --> 02:14:40,117
Rapidly!

1017
02:14:44,074 --> 02:14:45,064
Stop!

1018
02:14:47,036 --> 02:14:49,017
All at the same time!

1019
02:14:51,993 --> 02:14:55,918
It was hell. Sully's children.

1020
02:14:55,942 --> 02:14:59,883
- To take off. Not you.
- Sit down!

1021
02:15:11,734 --> 02:15:15,201
700 meters. The signal is clear.

1022
02:15:17,278 --> 02:15:20,235
- Go back up!
- Shoot!

1023
02:15:23,215 --> 02:15:26,152
- It's out!
- Come on, Tuk.

1024
02:15:26,176 --> 02:15:31,102
Go away! The
path! I attract them!

1025
02:15:32,104 --> 02:15:35,036
Payakan, dive!

1026
02:15:35,060 --> 02:15:38,017
Tuk, wait.

1027
02:15:46,919 --> 02:15:49,862
- 300 meters.
- Depth charges ready.

1028
02:15:49,886 --> 02:15:51,867
Dude, dude, dude!

1029
02:15:57,920 --> 02:16:02,834
No bombs. Children are
worth nothing if they are dead.

1030
02:16:03,518 --> 02:16:05,489
The waiting fire.

1031
02:16:09,628 --> 02:16:13,576
Circle them. Launch the submarines.

1032
02:16:14,859 --> 02:16:17,802
Subs in the tub!

1033
02:17:04,956 --> 02:17:06,939
Crabs, turn right.

1034
02:17:12,087 --> 02:17:15,028
- They must not escape.
- Wings in!

1035
02:17:15,052 --> 02:17:17,020
Such!

1036
02:17:47,655 --> 02:17:49,623
Pull the devil.

1037
02:18:19,788 --> 02:18:21,760
Where is Tuk?

1038
02:18:38,547 --> 02:18:39,535
Tuk!

1039
02:18:41,524 --> 02:18:42,512
Target in sight.

1040
02:18:47,435 --> 02:18:51,383
- It happens!
- We have to leave.

1041
02:19:06,207 --> 02:19:08,185
Change network. Guy.

1042
02:19:28,857 --> 02:19:31,788
Wait!

1043
02:19:31,812 --> 02:19:35,762
- You must beware! Move your hand!
- Hurry up!

1044
02:19:40,690 --> 02:19:42,665
To come back!

1045
02:19:47,614 --> 02:19:50,573
- Drop your weapon!
- Put the!

1046
02:19:51,569 --> 02:19:53,534
Stay here.

1047
02:19:54,521 --> 02:19:56,478
Come here, kid!

1048
02:19:56,502 --> 02:19:58,493
Put down your weapon!

1049
02:19:59,461 --> 02:20:02,403
- Put the!
- Drop the knife!

1050
02:20:02,427 --> 02:20:06,358
Hi, stop! You must not hurt them!

1051
02:20:06,382 --> 02:20:07,359
Stay still!

1052
02:20:07,383 --> 02:20:12,322
- Brother, are you okay?
- I've never felt better.

1053
02:20:19,232 --> 02:20:23,151
Return to the bridge.
Make sure he stays there!

1054
02:20:23,175 --> 02:20:25,144
I am on my way.

1055
02:20:25,168 --> 02:20:31,094
I remember you well.
Chain them to the railing.

1056
02:20:32,079 --> 02:20:34,032
Go on!

1057
02:20:34,056 --> 02:20:37,978
- Watch out, they bite.
- On your knees.

1058
02:20:38,002 --> 02:20:39,974
Come with your hand.

1059
02:20:40,961 --> 02:20:42,939
And then the other.

1060
02:20:45,911 --> 02:20:47,867
Be brave.

1061
02:20:51,836 --> 02:20:52,824
Na'vier!

1062
02:20:55,778 --> 02:20:58,748
- Wait!
- Left flank!

1063
02:21:01,707 --> 02:21:03,684
Stop! Stop them!

1064
02:21:05,667 --> 02:21:07,637
It's Sully.

1065
02:21:10,521 --> 02:21:12,491
300 meters.

1066
02:21:18,119 --> 02:21:22,068
They have our children.
Your daughter, Tuk, Lo'ak...

1067
02:21:25,034 --> 02:21:28,972
Jake, tell your friends to back off.

1068
02:21:28,996 --> 02:21:33,923
If you want your children,
you will show up alone.

1069
02:21:35,899 --> 02:21:38,870
You know you don't
doubt my composure.

1070
02:21:42,827 --> 02:21:47,735
I took you under my wing,
Jake, and you betrayed me.

1071
02:21:47,759 --> 02:21:53,700
You killed your comrades. I will
not hesitate to execute your son.

1072
02:21:55,666 --> 02:21:57,642
Now wait a bit.

1073
02:22:08,129 --> 02:22:10,083
Stay here.

1074
02:22:10,107 --> 02:22:16,005
They are performer killers.
They must die. Here today.

1075
02:22:16,029 --> 02:22:21,953
They are only after me. That's why they
hunted down the Tulkuns and took our children.

1076
02:22:24,914 --> 02:22:28,875
It's your fault! Your!

1077
02:22:31,839 --> 02:22:34,796
So I have to do it.

1078
02:22:40,336 --> 02:22:44,266
Offer expires soon.
What would it be?

1079
02:22:44,290 --> 02:22:48,228
Stop shooting. I'm coming.

1080
02:22:58,120 --> 02:23:00,099
MaJake, what's going on?

1081
02:23:01,087 --> 02:23:03,050
MaJake?

1082
02:23:05,030 --> 02:23:07,986
Be vigilant, everyone.

1083
02:23:24,785 --> 02:23:28,747
- To the point.
- If you shoot now, they will attack.

1084
02:23:30,708 --> 02:23:31,714
Wait until he's on board.

1085
02:23:59,275 --> 02:24:01,239
Payakan!

1086
02:24:12,131 --> 02:24:14,095
Shoot! Shoot!

1087
02:24:16,072 --> 02:24:17,071
Brother!

1088
02:24:21,994 --> 02:24:24,954
Take the tour! Turn me!

1089
02:24:24,978 --> 02:24:28,922
Set me on fire! Now now!

1090
02:24:47,685 --> 02:24:50,653
Get out, quick!

1091
02:24:52,617 --> 02:24:55,591
Set me on fire!

1092
02:25:03,502 --> 02:25:05,474
Duck!

1093
02:25:08,342 --> 02:25:10,316
Holy shit!

1094
02:25:14,273 --> 02:25:16,257
Give fire! Give fire!

1095
02:25:21,182 --> 02:25:23,149
Sully approaches. Keep an eye on him.

1096
02:25:23,173 --> 02:25:26,125
Come on, sit down!

1097
02:26:06,637 --> 02:26:08,618
So shoot something!

1098
02:26:25,020 --> 02:26:26,013
Stop!

1099
02:27:21,316 --> 02:27:23,292
After them!

1100
02:27:39,709 --> 02:27:43,665
Leak! Masks on!

1101
02:28:22,198 --> 02:28:24,163
Get him out!

1102
02:28:45,122 --> 02:28:46,111
Hurry up!

1103
02:28:58,961 --> 02:29:02,879
- Damage report?
- Bedrooms 2 and 3 are underwater.

1104
02:29:02,903 --> 02:29:04,876
Are you OK

1105
02:29:33,526 --> 02:29:37,457
- Harbor for the bow!
- Difficult to put in communication!

1106
02:29:37,481 --> 02:29:39,459
Set me on fire!

1107
02:29:40,450 --> 02:29:41,444
Now I have you!

1108
02:29:59,206 --> 02:30:02,154
- Get us for free!
- He's not reacting.

1109
02:30:02,178 --> 02:30:06,123
- Cut the cable!
- Who has the harpoon now?

1110
02:30:10,085 --> 02:30:12,066
Full power behind!

1111
02:30:23,827 --> 02:30:25,798
Leave the harpoon!

1112
02:30:28,085 --> 02:30:31,027
No cable, silly!

1113
02:30:31,051 --> 02:30:33,004
We are destroyed.

1114
02:30:33,028 --> 02:30:37,928
- We take water.
- Prepare your weapons!

1115
02:30:37,952 --> 02:30:42,884
- Otherwise, I thought you were so smart.
- Make up for the lack of food, Garvin.

1116
02:30:42,908 --> 02:30:46,831
Where have you gone, crafty Satan?

1117
02:30:46,855 --> 02:30:49,806
You probably think you're crafty, huh?

1118
02:31:04,620 --> 02:31:05,610
Duck!

1119
02:31:17,470 --> 02:31:20,412
- The pumps do not work.
- All men aboard!

1120
02:31:20,436 --> 02:31:23,405
Get him on a boat! Hurry up, guys!

1121
02:31:30,523 --> 02:31:34,455
- Neteyam!
- Do you need help, little brother?

1122
02:31:34,479 --> 02:31:37,442
Now clap and set us free.

1123
02:31:39,430 --> 02:31:42,388
- Get Tuk out of here.
- Hurry up!

1124
02:31:44,280 --> 02:31:49,206
Who is the mighty warrior?
Say it. Let's get out of here.

1125
02:31:51,176 --> 02:31:52,184
Lo'ak!

1126
02:31:53,152 --> 02:31:58,106
They have Spider. We have to save him.
Come on, we can't let him down.

1127
02:32:06,826 --> 02:32:08,801
Leave me!

1128
02:32:11,748 --> 02:32:12,751
Nope!

1129
02:32:14,721 --> 02:32:15,709
Ahh!

1130
02:32:19,542 --> 02:32:22,968
- Up with you, baby.
- I'm not your cunt, pig.

1131
02:32:23,570 --> 02:32:26,523
- We have to save her.
- Tuk, wait!

1132
02:32:26,547 --> 02:32:29,497
Sully is a fussy person.

1133
02:32:39,390 --> 02:32:43,338
Wait wait! Ready to go!

1134
02:32:44,805 --> 02:32:46,794
- Tighten the mask.
- Leave me alone.

1135
02:32:51,262 --> 02:32:55,216
Hurry up! It's an evacuation!

1136
02:32:58,169 --> 02:33:01,147
Tuk, that's not a good idea.

1137
02:33:38,984 --> 02:33:41,944
Cut here. Go on.

1138
02:33:49,847 --> 02:33:50,845
I got it.

1139
02:33:57,772 --> 02:34:00,702
We can still get there.

1140
02:34:00,726 --> 02:34:03,694
Now I'm attached again!

1141
02:34:30,070 --> 02:34:32,063
- Come on brother.
- Off.

1142
02:34:35,473 --> 02:34:36,496
Thanks guys.

1143
02:34:38,990 --> 02:34:41,947
Race! Go brother!

1144
02:34:42,942 --> 02:34:44,912
Run Run run!

1145
02:34:46,388 --> 02:34:48,358
Give me that.

1146
02:34:52,301 --> 02:34:54,298
- Run Run run!
- This way!

1147
02:35:02,189 --> 02:35:03,186
Covered!

1148
02:35:09,106 --> 02:35:11,091
Can you see them?

1149
02:35:20,950 --> 02:35:23,921
Bro, that was too crazy.

1150
02:35:28,865 --> 02:35:30,817
- To jump!
- Go on.

1151
02:35:30,841 --> 02:35:33,806
Your skxawng. I am hurt.

1152
02:35:37,759 --> 02:35:40,718
Shit! Give me a hand!

1153
02:35:43,684 --> 02:35:46,641
- Hold it!
- I got it.

1154
02:35:48,633 --> 02:35:50,616
- Take it.
- I got it.

1155
02:35:52,573 --> 02:35:55,543
- Holy shit.
- Hold it!

1156
02:35:56,543 --> 02:35:58,489
Go brother.

1157
02:35:58,513 --> 02:36:02,431
- Got you.
- Hurry up!

1158
02:36:02,455 --> 02:36:04,443
They have Kiri and Tuk.

1159
02:36:05,411 --> 02:36:07,398
I can't turn around.

1160
02:36:13,028 --> 02:36:16,005
Sheep! To help! It's Neteyam!

1161
02:36:16,973 --> 02:36:18,965
- Quick!
- Take it.

1162
02:36:21,925 --> 02:36:25,894
Neteyam is injured! Hurry up!

1163
02:36:26,883 --> 02:36:28,847
Shoot!

1164
02:36:30,814 --> 02:36:31,818
Watch his head.

1165
02:36:33,786 --> 02:36:34,786
Go on!

1166
02:36:37,739 --> 02:36:40,712
Watch his head.

1167
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:44,644
- Don't worry bro, we got you.
- Oh no.

1168
02:36:46,626 --> 02:36:49,589
Press it.

1169
02:36:50,578 --> 02:36:52,555
- Dad...
- I'm here.

1170
02:36:56,506 --> 02:36:58,478
I am with you, my boy.

1171
02:37:03,421 --> 02:37:05,394
I want to go home.

1172
02:37:07,371 --> 02:37:11,336
I know. We should probably go home.

1173
02:37:14,295 --> 02:37:17,261
- It will be fine.
- Sheep...

1174
02:37:24,161 --> 02:37:25,161
Neteyam?

1175
02:37:30,094 --> 02:37:33,031
No no no...

1176
02:37:33,055 --> 02:37:34,061
Netay!

1177
02:37:39,985 --> 02:37:43,923
Netay! No, all courage is...

1178
02:37:47,888 --> 02:37:51,841
My son! My son!

1179
02:37:57,769 --> 02:38:00,721
My son!

1180
02:38:09,622 --> 02:38:12,586
Can you hear me, Corporal?

1181
02:38:13,583 --> 02:38:17,501
I think you can.

1182
02:38:17,525 --> 02:38:20,493
I have your daughters.

1183
02:38:21,477 --> 02:38:23,460
Same offer as before.

1184
02:38:24,442 --> 02:38:26,419
You for them.

1185
02:38:30,878 --> 02:38:33,847
Where are your sisters

1186
02:38:34,815 --> 02:38:36,777
Where are they?

1187
02:38:36,801 --> 02:38:40,739
- I do not know.
- They're trapped aboard the ship.

1188
02:38:40,763 --> 02:38:45,680
They are at the moon pool.
On the well deck, amidships.

1189
02:38:45,704 --> 02:38:49,626
Come, I'll show you.

1190
02:38:49,650 --> 02:38:55,541
Answer me, Corporal. Spit it
out or there will be consequences.

1191
02:38:55,565 --> 02:38:57,529
I heard you.

1192
02:38:57,553 --> 02:39:02,495
Come on, we have to go. Go on.

1193
02:39:03,463 --> 02:39:05,456
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1194
02:39:07,424 --> 02:39:10,400
Listen to me. They have our daughters.

1195
02:39:11,368 --> 02:39:13,353
They have our daughters.

1196
02:39:15,332 --> 02:39:20,249
I need you to be with me
and I need you to be strong.

1197
02:39:20,273 --> 02:39:25,180
At present. Strong in heart.

1198
02:39:25,704 --> 02:39:27,694
Strong in heart.

1199
02:39:41,045 --> 02:39:44,012
Now we save our daughters.

1200
02:39:57,833 --> 02:40:00,806
- Stay with your brother.
- I want to go with you.

1201
02:40:03,772 --> 02:40:07,708
- You've done enough.
- Sheep...

1202
02:40:10,674 --> 02:40:11,673
The waiting fire.

1203
02:40:13,634 --> 02:40:14,615
Go on.

1204
02:40:14,639 --> 02:40:16,597
He is on his way.

1205
02:40:17,604 --> 02:40:19,557
I'm good. Go go!

1206
02:40:21,540 --> 02:40:23,529
Now we strangle it. That's why we are here.

1207
02:40:28,470 --> 02:40:31,428
- Stay with him.
- Nope!

1208
02:40:32,416 --> 02:40:34,396
Be vigilant, guys.

1209
02:40:54,628 --> 02:40:55,629
Now.

1210
02:41:03,521 --> 02:41:06,464
- Where are they?
- On the deck of the submarine.

1211
02:41:06,488 --> 02:41:10,443
There is a well in the middle.
They are at the railing.

1212
02:41:13,418 --> 02:41:15,400
No, stay here.

1213
02:41:17,373 --> 02:41:22,318
Talk to me, Corporal. The ship is sinking
and your daughters are sinking with it.

1214
02:41:23,272 --> 02:41:28,216
Your son didn't have
to die. It was your fault.

1215
02:41:34,171 --> 02:41:39,085
You thought you could protect
your family, but you can't.

1216
02:41:39,109 --> 02:41:42,071
There is only one solution.

1217
02:41:45,033 --> 02:41:48,984
Now let's get it over with
before we lose another youngster.

1218
02:41:59,843 --> 02:42:01,818
Covered!

1219
02:42:42,332 --> 02:42:45,264
- Who is affected?
- Zdinarsik?

1220
02:42:45,288 --> 02:42:46,289
Secured.

1221
02:42:47,256 --> 02:42:49,245
Prague, are you there?

1222
02:42:50,239 --> 02:42:52,195
Look for!

1223
02:43:01,087 --> 02:43:02,086
Forward!

1224
02:43:04,059 --> 02:43:05,061
To the left!

1225
02:43:06,029 --> 02:43:08,024
To the right. Surround her.

1226
02:43:53,452 --> 02:43:54,454
MaJake!

1227
02:44:02,373 --> 02:44:03,369
It's mom!

1228
02:44:09,771 --> 02:44:12,743
They are coming to kill you.

1229
02:45:03,123 --> 02:45:04,111
Sheep!

1230
02:45:07,086 --> 02:45:11,005
- Where is your sister?
- The path.

1231
02:45:11,029 --> 02:45:13,981
Stay behind me.

1232
02:45:17,939 --> 02:45:19,896
Kiri!

1233
02:45:19,920 --> 02:45:22,865
Time is running out, Corporal.

1234
02:45:22,889 --> 02:45:26,808
Do you really want to
lose another youngster?

1235
02:45:26,832 --> 02:45:29,778
You don't have to try!

1236
02:45:29,802 --> 02:45:32,729
Kill him, dad!

1237
02:45:32,753 --> 02:45:33,756
Kiri!

1238
02:45:35,724 --> 02:45:38,701
- Lower your weapons.
- You must not do this!

1239
02:45:40,907 --> 02:45:42,880
Keep them away.

1240
02:45:44,485 --> 02:45:45,484
Do it!

1241
02:45:48,602 --> 02:45:50,578
Nope...

1242
02:45:51,546 --> 02:45:54,494
- Put on handcuffs.
- Leave her alone.

1243
02:45:54,518 --> 02:45:59,438
Stay here! Don't come one step closer.

1244
02:45:59,462 --> 02:46:03,393
- Handcuffs!
- You stupid pig.

1245
02:46:03,417 --> 02:46:05,397
You don't have to do anything to him.

1246
02:46:08,350 --> 02:46:11,317
Drop it or I'll cut.

1247
02:46:14,271 --> 02:46:16,248
What is the kid doing to me?

1248
02:46:17,246 --> 02:46:21,166
It's not mine. We're not
even the same species.

1249
02:46:21,190 --> 02:46:26,105
You must not hurt
her. Let her go.

1250
02:46:26,129 --> 02:46:30,065
Now listen to me. Let her go.

1251
02:46:30,089 --> 02:46:36,000
- Mother, you must not kill him.
- A son for a son.

1252
02:46:36,994 --> 02:46:38,179
You must not hurt her.

1253
02:46:40,939 --> 02:46:44,896
- I cut.
- Now let her go.

1254
02:46:46,878 --> 02:46:48,859
Nope!

1255
02:46:56,760 --> 02:46:58,740
Kiri, Kiri...

1256
02:47:05,659 --> 02:47:09,576
- Spider!
- Get them out of here.

1257
02:47:09,600 --> 02:47:13,557
- Come with me.
- I owe you a death.

1258
02:47:16,505 --> 02:47:20,437
Mom, come on. Mother!

1259
02:47:20,461 --> 02:47:26,402
You don't spray, do you, Jake?
You know I never give up.

1260
02:47:27,371 --> 02:47:31,331
I will come and kill your whole family.

1261
02:47:32,763 --> 02:47:33,756
Sheep!

1262
02:47:34,759 --> 02:47:35,749
Come then.

1263
02:47:46,612 --> 02:47:48,574
Jack!

1264
02:47:51,546 --> 02:47:55,499
- The fire is coming!
- Back to the boat!

1265
02:47:58,467 --> 02:48:00,447
Stay by me.

1266
02:48:03,401 --> 02:48:04,396
Tuk!

1267
02:48:05,378 --> 02:48:07,350
Mother, take my hand!

1268
02:48:11,815 --> 02:48:13,781
Mother!

1269
02:48:14,777 --> 02:48:16,765
Come on, Kiri, we have to get out of here.

1270
02:48:20,702 --> 02:48:22,653
To climb up!

1271
02:48:22,677 --> 02:48:25,643
Come on Kiri. Race!

1272
02:48:26,630 --> 02:48:29,603
Bathing! Get in, Tuk!

1273
02:48:37,493 --> 02:48:38,491
Race!

1274
02:48:39,475 --> 02:48:41,450
- Mother!
- Run Run run!

1275
02:48:48,379 --> 02:48:50,351
Crawl on it!

1276
02:48:54,299 --> 02:48:56,273
I have you.

1277
02:48:57,265 --> 02:48:59,236
Give me your hand!

1278
02:49:02,190 --> 02:49:03,186
Open it!

1279
02:49:11,083 --> 02:49:14,028
- Open it!
- Back back!

1280
02:49:14,052 --> 02:49:15,041
Has come!

1281
02:49:16,037 --> 02:49:18,005
Tuk!

1282
02:49:26,902 --> 02:49:29,853
Up! Go on.

1283
02:49:31,824 --> 02:49:34,798
Crawl! Get up!

1284
02:49:40,718 --> 02:49:43,684
We guess! To continue!

1285
02:49:57,533 --> 02:50:00,486
Kiri, let's go!

1286
02:50:03,449 --> 02:50:05,427
This way!

1287
02:50:10,367 --> 02:50:12,344
Open it!

1288
02:50:14,316 --> 02:50:15,304
Mother!

1289
02:50:18,272 --> 02:50:19,265
Has come!

1290
02:50:28,164 --> 02:50:30,132
No, Tuk.

1291
02:50:31,130 --> 02:50:33,109
We can't go out!

1292
02:50:35,064 --> 02:50:38,035
- We'll stay together, okay?
- Yes.

1293
02:51:07,691 --> 02:51:10,649
All courage is, help us!

1294
02:51:53,126 --> 02:51:54,123
Kiri!

1295
02:52:13,885 --> 02:52:18,785
- Bridge!
- Mother and father are there.

1296
02:52:18,809 --> 02:52:21,782
- To input.
- I'm ready.

1297
02:52:49,457 --> 02:52:51,426
OK.

1298
02:53:18,092 --> 02:53:19,089
Jack!

1299
02:53:56,332 --> 02:53:57,330
Sheep?

1300
02:54:01,089 --> 02:54:02,081
Piss!

1301
02:54:17,747 --> 02:54:19,699
Come on, fool.

1302
02:54:19,757 --> 02:54:22,685
- Breathe, dad.
- Neteyam?

1303
02:54:22,823 --> 02:54:24,787
No, it's Lo'ak.

1304
02:54:24,811 --> 02:54:28,728
- Oh, Lo'ak...
- Sorry.

1305
02:54:28,752 --> 02:54:33,706
- Neteyam's death is my fault.
- Focus on the present.

1306
02:54:52,456 --> 02:54:55,430
The air pocket disappears. We
have to get out. Come on, dad.

1307
02:55:03,329 --> 02:55:07,297
- Can you find it from here?
- Yes, but it will be a long dive.

1308
02:55:08,265 --> 02:55:13,191
I can't handle it.
But you can. Hurry up.

1309
02:55:13,215 --> 02:55:17,153
I can't lose you too, dad.

1310
02:55:20,763 --> 02:55:22,736
Mom, I'm scared.

1311
02:55:23,810 --> 02:55:28,749
It will be fine. Stay
with me. Stay with mom.

1312
02:55:31,019 --> 02:55:32,978
It will be fine.

1313
02:55:48,801 --> 02:55:53,704
You just need to calm your
heart and be completely still.

1314
02:55:53,728 --> 02:55:56,700
Breathe from here.

1315
02:56:10,522 --> 02:56:14,483
The being of water
has no beginning or end.

1316
02:56:15,472 --> 02:56:19,392
The sea is around you and within you.

1317
02:56:19,416 --> 02:56:23,357
The sea is your home before
you are born and after you die.

1318
02:56:28,304 --> 02:56:32,235
The sea gives and the sea takes.

1319
02:56:32,259 --> 02:56:34,244
Water binds everything together.

1320
02:56:36,215 --> 02:56:38,178
Life and death.

1321
02:56:40,152 --> 02:56:42,132
Darkness and light.

1322
02:57:04,860 --> 02:57:06,817
- Hi.
- Kiri!

1323
02:57:06,841 --> 02:57:12,753
Everything will be fine, little sister.
Mom, I give you this.

1324
02:57:17,613 --> 02:57:19,569
It will help you.

1325
02:57:19,593 --> 02:57:22,535
Dad, you're fine.

1326
02:57:22,559 --> 02:57:26,511
Trust me. Say your heart.

1327
02:57:27,501 --> 02:57:29,476
Deep breathing.

1328
02:57:32,729 --> 02:57:34,709
Last breath.

1329
02:57:38,649 --> 02:57:39,658
Follow me.

1330
02:58:54,737 --> 02:58:58,670
Wait. Breathe.

1331
02:59:04,519 --> 02:59:05,507
Thank you.

1332
02:59:14,595 --> 02:59:16,586
I see you, my son.

1333
02:59:19,544 --> 02:59:21,500
MaJake!

1334
02:59:21,524 --> 02:59:24,489
Sheep! Sheep!

1335
02:59:25,477 --> 02:59:28,403
Has come. Come here.

1336
02:59:28,427 --> 02:59:31,399
- Tuk!
- Got you.

1337
02:59:36,335 --> 02:59:37,323
Brother.

1338
02:59:47,189 --> 02:59:50,153
Sully is a fussy person.

1339
02:59:51,148 --> 02:59:54,086
It was our greatest weakness -

1340
02:59:54,110 --> 02:59:57,049
and our great strength.

1341
02:59:57,073 --> 03:00:01,025
Thank you, Almoder. Thank you.

1342
03:00:39,559 --> 03:00:41,543
Let's get out of here.

1343
03:00:48,052 --> 03:00:50,017
My boy...

1344
03:00:50,787 --> 03:00:52,762
Come with me.

1345
03:00:56,944 --> 03:00:57,947
Spider!

1346
03:01:32,305 --> 03:01:33,313
Monkey!

1347
03:01:36,601 --> 03:01:38,580
Spider.

1348
03:01:45,481 --> 03:01:47,471
- Are you doing OK?
- Yes.

1349
03:01:51,030 --> 03:01:53,001
Come here.

1350
03:01:55,581 --> 03:01:58,552
A son for a son.

1351
03:02:14,350 --> 03:02:17,310
All singing strings have a final bead.

1352
03:02:42,532 --> 03:02:47,462
A father protects. This
is his purpose in life.

1353
03:03:15,121 --> 03:03:19,063
People say that all
energy is only borrowed.

1354
03:03:21,045 --> 03:03:24,009
One day it has to be returned.

1355
03:03:35,879 --> 03:03:40,795
Eywa takes care of all her children.

1356
03:03:41,432 --> 03:03:43,408
Nothing ever goes away.

1357
03:03:46,356 --> 03:03:49,311
Netay!

1358
03:04:09,075 --> 03:04:13,007
My family and I are leaving tomorrow.

1359
03:04:13,031 --> 03:04:15,961
Far from here.

1360
03:04:15,985 --> 03:04:21,914
Your son is with our ancestors.
You are metkayinas now.

1361
03:04:26,860 --> 03:04:29,827
That's how it happened.

1362
03:04:30,796 --> 03:04:32,786
We are now people of the sea.

1363
03:04:34,748 --> 03:04:37,720
It is our house.

1364
03:05:36,017 --> 03:05:39,928
Sheep! Look what I caught!

1365
03:05:39,952 --> 03:05:42,930
Wow, that's a big crab.

1366
03:05:43,898 --> 03:05:49,827
It was over there by
the rocks, as you said.

1367
03:05:53,777 --> 03:05:57,736
What's the matter, dad?
Why are you crying?

1368
03:05:58,739 --> 03:06:01,691
I'm just glad to see you.

1369
03:06:03,660 --> 03:06:05,651
I'm glad to see you too.

1370
03:06:07,616 --> 03:06:09,604
You try.

1371
03:06:11,566 --> 03:06:12,568
OK.

1372
03:06:14,523 --> 03:06:17,506
- Did you leave me some?
- Maybe.

1373
03:06:23,415 --> 03:06:24,422
Now look there.

1374
03:06:32,314 --> 03:06:37,243
Now I see it. I can't save
my family by running away.

1375
03:06:37,267 --> 03:06:42,655
This is our home, our fortress.

1376
03:06:43,935 --> 03:06:46,801
This is where we are.
